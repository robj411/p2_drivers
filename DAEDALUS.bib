We crossrandomized mask type (cloth versus surgical) and promotion strategies at the village and household level. Proper mask-wearing increased from 13.3\% in the control group to 42.3\% in the intervention arm (adjusted percentage point difference = 0.29; 95\% confidence interval = [0.26, 0.31]). The intervention reduced symptomatic seroprevalence (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.91 [0.82, 1.00]), especially among adults {$\geq$}60 years old in villages where surgical masks were distributed (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.65 [0.45, 0.85]). Mask distribution with promotion was a scalable and effective method to reduce symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of strong distancing measures, such as lockdowns, against their economic costs, especially the burdens imposed on low income and food insecure households. The distancing measures deployed by South Africa impose large economic costs and have negative implications for the factor distribution of income. Labor with low education levels are much more strongly affected than labor with secondary or tertiary education. As a result, households with low levels of educational attainment and high dependence on labor income would experience an enormous real income shock that would clearly jeopardize the food security of these households. However, in South Africa, total incomes for low income households are significantly insulated by government transfer payments. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of Covid-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of `black swan' type shocks.},

  abstract = {The recurrence of influenza A epidemics has originally been explained by a "continuous antigenic drift" scenario. Recently, it has been shown that if genetic drift is gradual, the evolution of influenza A main antigen, the haemagglutinin, is punctuated. As a consequence, it has been suggested that influenza A dynamics at the population level should be approximated by a serial SIR model. Here, simple models are used to test whether a serial SIR model requires gradual antigenic drift within groups of strains with the same antigenic properties (antigenic clusters). We compare the effect of status based and history based frameworks and the influence of reduced susceptibility and infectivity assumptions on the transient dynamics of antigenic clusters. Our results reveal that the replacement of a resident antigenic cluster by a mutant cluster, as observed in data, is reproduced only by the status based model integrating the reduced infectivity assumption. This combination of assumptions is useful to overcome the otherwise extremely high model dimensionality of models incorporating many strains, but relies on a biological hypothesis not obviously satisfied. Our findings finally suggest the dynamical importance of gradual antigenic drift even in the presence of punctuated immune escape. A more regular renewal of susceptible pool than the one implemented in a serial SIR model should be part of a minimal theory for influenza at the population level. {\copyright} 2009 Ballesteros et al.},

A key question facing policymakers is the extentof persistent damage (scarring) that may result fromthis crisis. This chapter examines the possible persistenteffects of the pandemic and the channels through whichthey may occur. History suggests that deep recessionsoften leave long-lived scars, particularly to productivity.Importantly, financial instabilities---typically associatedwith worse scarring---have been largely avoided in thecurrent crisis so far. The concentration of the pandemic'sinitial impact on more highly contact-intensive servicesectors has generated lower sectoral spillovers than in mostprevious recessions, but its sheer size means that it stillrepresents a large shock to the broader economy. Expectedmedium-term output losses from the pandemic are sub-stantial, with output for the world in 2024 expected tobe about 3 percent lower than anticipated pre-pandemic.Losses are anticipated to be lower than after the globalfinancial crisis, assuming that the pandemic is broughtunder control globally by the end of 2022. The degree ofexpected scarring varies across countries, depending on thestructure of economies and the size of the policy response.Emerging market and developing economies are expectedto suffer more scarring than advanced economies. Tolimit scarring, policymakers should continue to providesupport to the most-affected sectors and workers while thepandemic is ongoing. Remedial policies for the setbackto human capital accumulation, measures to lift invest-ment, and initiatives to support reallocation (retraining,reskilling, and insolvency procedures) will be key toaddress long-term GDP losses and the rise in inequality.},

  abstract = {Background In October 2019, Mexico approved a law to establish that nonalcoholic beverages and packaged foods that exceed a threshold for added calories, sugars, fats, trans fat, or sodium should have an ``excess of'' warning label. We aimed to estimate the expected reduction in the obesity prevalence and obesity costs in Mexico by introducing warning labels, over 5 years, among adults under 60 years of age. Methods and findings Baseline intakes of beverages and snacks were obtained from the 2016 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey. The expected impact of labels on caloric intake was obtained from an experimental study, with a 10.5\% caloric reduction for beverages and 3.0\% caloric reduction for snacks. The caloric reduction was introduced into a dynamic model to estimate weight change. The model output was then used to estimate the expected changes in the prevalence of obesity and overweight. To predict obesity costs, we used the Health Ministry report of the impact of overweight and obesity in Mexico 1999--2023. We estimated a mean caloric reduction of 36.8 kcal/day/person (23.2 kcal/day from beverages and 13.6 kcal/day from snacks). Five years after implementation, this caloric reduction could reduce 1.68 kg and 4.98 percentage points (pp) in obesity (14.7\%, with respect to baseline), which translates into a reduction of 1.3 million cases of obesity and a reduction of US\$1.8 billion in direct and indirect costs. Our estimate is based on experimental evidence derived from warning labels as proposed in Canada, which include a single label and less restrictive limits to sugar, sodium, and saturated fats. Our estimates depend on various assumptions, such as the transportability of effect estimates from the experimental study to the Mexican population and that other factors that could influence weight and food and beverage consumption remain unchanged. Our results will need to be corroborated by future observational studies through the analysis of changes in sales, consumption, and body weight. Conclusions In this study, we estimated that warning labels may effectively reduce obesity and obesity-related costs. Mexico is following Chile, Peru, and Uruguay in implementing warning labels to processed foods, but other countries could benefit from this intervention.},

  abstract = {Background: In an effort to prevent continued increases in obesity and diabetes, in January 2014, the Mexican government implemented an 8\% tax on nonessential foods with energy density {$\geq$}275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Limited rigorous evaluations of food taxes exist worldwide. The objective of this study was to examine changes in volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in response to these taxes in the entire sample and stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). Methods and Findings: This study uses data on household packaged food purchases representative of the Mexican urban population from The Nielsen Company's Mexico Consumer Panel Services (CPS). We included 6,248 households that participated in the Nielsen CPS in at least 2 mo during 2012--2014; average household follow-up was 32.7 mo. We analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014, using a longitudinal, fixed-effects model that adjusted for preexisting trends to test whether the observed post-tax trend was significantly different from the one expected based on the pre-tax trend. We controlled for household characteristics and contextual factors like minimum salary and unemployment rate. The mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 changed by -25 g (95\% confidence interval = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1\% change beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax (2012--2013) trends, with no corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased on average 10.2\% less taxed foods than expected (-44 [--72, --16] g per capita per month); medium SES households purchased 5.8\% less taxed foods than expected (-28 [--46, --11] g per capita per month), whereas high SES households' purchases did not change. The main limitations of our findings are the inability to infer causality because the taxes were implemented at the national level (lack of control group), our sample is only representative of urban areas, we only have 2 y of data prior to the tax, and, as with any consumer panel survey, we did not capture all foods purchased by the household. Conclusions: Household purchases of nonessential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after the implementation of Mexico's SSB and nonessential foods taxes. Future studies should evaluate the impact of the taxes on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns (see S1 Abstract in Spanish).},

  abstract = {Background: Workplaces are an important potential source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; however, investigation into workplace contact patterns is lacking. This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and features of contact varied between occupations across the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Methods: Data were obtained from electronic contact diaries (November 2020-November 2021) submitted by employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616). We used mixed models to investigate the effects of occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people sharing workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings. Findings: Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78\% [95\% CI: 75--81\%]) and education workers (64\% [59\%--69\%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36\% [32\%--40\%] and 38\% [33\%--43\%] respectively). Education workers also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51\% [44\%--57\%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across all occupational groups, workspace sharing and close contact increased and usage of face coverings decreased during phases of less stringent restrictions. Interpretation: Major variations in workplace contact patterns and mask use likely contribute to differential COVID-19 risk. Patterns of variation by occupation and restriction phase may inform interventions for future waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory epidemics. Across occupations, increasing workplace contact and reduced face covering usage is concerning given ongoing high levels of community transmission and emergence of variants.

  abstract = {In recent years, academics and policymakers have increasingly recognized that the full societal value of vaccination encompasses broad health, economic, and social benefits beyond avoided morbidity and mortality due to infection by the targeted pathogen and limited health care costs. Nevertheless, standard economic evaluations of vaccines continue to focus on a relatively narrow set of health-centric benefits, with consequences for vaccination policies and public investments.The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates in stark terms the multiplicity and magnitude of harms that infectious diseases may inflict on society. COVID-19 has overtaxed health systems, disrupted routine immunization programs, forced school and workplace closures, impeded the operation of international supply chains, suppressed aggregate demand, and exacerbated existing social inequities.The obvious nature of the pandemic's broad effects could conceivably convince more policymakers to identify and account for the full societal impacts of infectious disease when evaluating the potential benefits of vaccination. Such a shift could make a big difference in how we allocate societal resources in the service of population health and in how much we stand to gain from that spending.},

We assessed if the emergence of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant in autumn 2020 could be linked to higher case fatality rates, compared to original wild-type COVID-19, subgrouping by age band, sex, deprivation or month of diagnosis as potential risk factors. Methods: Observational study and secondary analysis were conducted of SARS-CoV-2 cases diagnosed due to medical need or occupational exposure in an administrative area of Eastern England, UK (base population 1 million), who first tested positive in the period 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine relationships of age group, sex, deprivation group and month of diagnosis with case fatality rates within 28~days of diagnosis. Marginal probabilities for risk of dying were calculated separately for the first two main `wave' periods of the English pandemic. Results: Older age and male sex consistently raised the risk of mortality in both wave periods. Higher deprivation was linked to mortality risk in the first wave period, but not in the second wave. Mortality decreased over time during the first wave period, but slightly increased over time during the second wave. Cases were younger in the second wave, and median age of the deceased varied little between waves. Interpretation: The Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 did not lead to higher mortality rates for any age, deprivation or sex group, compared to case fatality rates in the early part of the pandemic period.},

  abstract = {This paper develops the argument that post-COVID-19 recovery strategies need to focus on building back fairer cities and communities, and that this requires a strong embedding of ` age-friendly' principles to support marginalised groups of older people, especially those living in deprived urban neighbourhoods, trapped in poor quality housing. It shows that older people living in such areas are likely to experience a `double lockdown' as a result of restrictions imposed by social distancing combined with the intensification of social and spatial inequalities. This argument is presented as follows: first, the paper examines the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on older people, highlighting how the pandemic is both creating new and reinforcing existing inequalities in ageing along the lines of gender, class, ethnicity, race, ability and sexuality. Second, the paper explores the role of spatial inequalities in the context of COVID-19, highlighting how the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on deprived urban areas already affected by cuts to public services, the loss of social infrastructure and pressures on the voluntary sector. Finally, the paper examines how interrelated social inequalities at both the individual and spatial level are affecting the lives of older people living in deprived urban neighbourhoods during the pandemic. The paper concludes by developing six principles for `age-friendly' community recovery planning aimed at maintaining and improving the quality of life and wellbeing of older residents in the post-pandemic city.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Using 40 countries' subnational data, we estimate age-specific mortality-temperature relationships and extrapolate them to countries without data today and into a future with climate change. We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extre6me cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates, especially for the elderly. Critically, this relationship is flattened by higher incomes and adaptation to local climate. Using a revealed-preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs, we estimate that the mean global increase in mortality risk due to climate change, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs, is valued at roughly 3.2\% of global GDP in 2100 under a high-emissions scenario. Notably, today's cold locations are projected to benefit, while today's poor and hot locations have large projected damages. Finally, our central estimates indicate that the release of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mortality-related damages of \$36.6 under a high-emissions scenario, with an interquartile range accounting for both econometric and climate uncertainty of [-\$7.8, \$73.0]. These empirically grounded estimates exceed the previous literature's estimates by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Background: The level of herd immunity before and after the first 2009 pandemic season is not precisely known, and predicting the shape of the next pandemic H1N1 season is a difficult challenge.Methods: This was a modelling study based on data on medical visits for influenza-like illness collected by the French General Practitioner Sentinel network, as well as pandemic H1N1 vaccination coverage rates, and an individual-centred model devoted to influenza. We estimated infection attack rates during the first 2009 pandemic H1N1 season in France, and the rates of pre- and post-exposure immunity. We then simulated various scenarios in which a pandemic influenza H1N1 virus would be reintroduced into a population with varying levels of protective cross-immunity, and considered the impact of extending influenza vaccination.Results: During the first pandemic season in France, the proportion of infected persons was 18.1\% overall, 38.3\% among children, 14.8\% among younger adults and 1.6\% among the elderly. The rates of pre-exposure immunity required to fit data collected during the first pandemic season were 36\% in younger adults and 85\% in the elderly. We estimated that the rate of post-exposure immunity was 57.3\% (95\% Confidence Interval (95\%CI) 49.6\%-65.0\%) overall, 44.6\% (95\%CI 35.5\%-53.6\%) in children, 53.8\% (95\%CI 44.5\%-63.1\%) in younger adults, and 87.4\% (95\%CI 82.0\%-92.8\%) in the elderly.The shape of a second season would depend on the degree of persistent protective cross-immunity to descendants of the 2009 H1N1 viruses. A cross-protection rate of 70\% would imply that only a small proportion of the population would be affected. With a cross-protection rate of 50\%, the second season would have a disease burden similar to the first, while vaccination of 50\% of the entire population, in addition to the population vaccinated during the first pandemic season, would halve this burden. With a cross-protection rate of 30\%, the second season could be more substantial, and vaccination would not provide a significant benefit.Conclusions: These model-based findings should help to prepare for a second pandemic season, and highlight the need for studies of the different components of immune protection. {\copyright} 2010 Carrat et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In seeking to justify its recommendations to the NHS about which technologies to fund, NICE claims to adopt two complementary ethical frameworks, one procedural---accountability for reasonableness (AfR)---and one substantive---an `ethics of opportunity costs' (EOC) that rests primarily on the notion of allocative efficiency. This study is the first to empirically examine normative changes to NICE's approach and to analyse whether these enhance or diminish the fairness of its decision-making, as judged against these frameworks. It finds that increasing formalisation of NICE's approach and a weakening of the burden of proof laid on technologies undergoing HTA have together undermined its commitment to EOC. This implies a loss of allocative efficiency and a shift in the balance of how the interests of different NHS users are served, in favour of those who benefit directly from NICE's recommendations. These changes also weaken NICE's commitment to AfR by diminishing the publicity of its decision-making and by encouraging the adoption of rationales that cannot easily be shown to meet the relevance condition. This signals a need for either substantial reform of NICE's approach, or more accurate communication of the ethical reasoning on which it is based. The study also highlights the need for further empirical work to explore the impact of these policy changes on NICE's practice of HTA and to better understand how and why they have come about.},

Individuals with OWOB suffered more symptoms compared with individuals without OWOB (median 3 vs. 2, p = 0.037), including more cough and shortness of breath (p = 0.023 and 0.026, respectively). Adolescents with OWOB were more likely to be symptomatic (66.7\% vs. 34.2\%, p = 0.008) and have longer respiratory symptoms (median 7 vs. 4 days, p = 0.049) compared with adolescents without OWOB. Lower RT-PCR Ct values were found in children and symptomatic individuals compared with adolescent and adults and asymptomatic individuals, respectively (p = 0.001 and 0.022). Conclusions: Adolescents and adults with OWOB experience more respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 despite similar viral loads. These findings underscore the importance of vaccinating individuals with OWOB.},

  abstract = {Growing up in socio-economic disadvantage has important and long-lasting effects on children's lives. Children from disadvantaged households often fall behind in many areas of well-being and development, with effects that continue to limit their opportunities and outcomes -- including their health and labour market outcomes -- long after they reach adulthood. Drawing on Europe-wide survey data from 27 countries, this paper explores how childhood socio-economic disadvantage affects later adult labour market and health outcomes and evaluates the country-level GDP-equivalent cost of childhood disadvantage due to lost employment, lost earnings, and lost health, as well as the costs of lost government revenue and extra benefit spending. Results point to large costs for societies from childhood socio-economic disadvantage, totalling on average the equivalent of 3.5\% of GDP annually. We also show that the labour market penalties linked to childhood disadvantage are often smaller in countries with lower absolute levels of disadvantage. While not causal evidence, these associations suggest much of the impact of childhood disadvantage in adulthood can be mitigated with the right environment and policy set up in childhood.},

  abstract = {Background Obesity represents an urgent problem that needs to be properly addressed, especially among children. Public and global health policy- and decision-makers need timely, reliable quantitative information to develop effective interventions aimed at counteracting the burden generated by high body mass index (BMI). Few studies have assessed the high-BMI-related burden on a global scale. Methods and findings Following the methodology framework and analytical strategies used in the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017, the global deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to high BMI were analyzed by age, sex, year, and geographical location and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI). All causes of death and DALYs estimated in GBD 2017 were organized into 4 hierarchical levels: level 1 contained 3 broad cause groupings, level 2 included more specific categories within the level 1 groupings, level 3 comprised more detailed causes within the level 2 categories, and level 4 included sub-causes of some level 3 causes. From 1990 to 2017, the global deaths and DALYs attributable to high BMI have more than doubled for both females and males. However, during the study period, the age-standardized rate of high-BMI-related deaths remained stable for females and only increased by 14.5\% for males, and the age-standardized rate of high-BMI-related DALYs only increased by 12.7\% for females and 26.8\% for males. In 2017, the 6 leading GBD level 3 causes of high-BMI-related DALYs were ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertensive heart disease, and low back pain. For most GBD level 3 causes of high-BMI-related DALYs, high-income North America had the highest attributable proportions of age-standardized DALYs due to high BMI among the 21 GBD regions in both sexes, whereas the lowest attributable proportions were observed in high-income Asia Pacific for females and in eastern sub-Saharan Africa for males. The association between SDI and high-BMI-related DALYs suggested that the lowest age-standardized DALY rates were found in countries in the low-SDI quintile and high-SDI quintile in 2017, and from 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized DALY rates tended to increase in regions with the lowest SDI, but declined in regions with the highest SDI, with the exception of high-income North America. The study's main limitations included the use of information collected from some self-reported data, the employment of cutoff values that may not be adequate for all populations and groups at risk, and the use of a metric that cannot distinguish between lean and fat mass. Conclusions In this study, we observed that the number of global deaths and DALYs attributable to high BMI has substantially increased between 1990 and 2017. Successful population-wide initiatives targeting high BMI may mitigate the burden of a wide range of diseases. Given the large variations in high-BMI-related burden of disease by SDI, future strategies to prevent and reduce the burden should be developed and implemented based on country-specific development status.},

Productivity losses build up over time and are estimated to range between 0.4\% and 2.1\% after 45 years, for 12 weeks and 2 years of school closure, respectively. These results appear to be broadly consistent with earlier findings in the literature. Two opposing effects might influence these estimates. Online teaching would lower economic costs while learning losses in tertiary education (not considered here) would inflate them. Policies aimed at improving the quality of education and adult training will be needed to offset or, at least, alleviate the impact of the pandemic on human capital.},

  abstract = {The basic reproduction number {$R$}               0               is arguably the most important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology. The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of {$R$}               0               where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the               NGM with large domain               and the               NGM with small domain               . The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of {$R$}               0               . We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number {$R$}               0               . Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that {$R$}               0               defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter               r               , the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that {$R$}               0               {$>$} 1 if and only if               r               {$>$} 0, and {$R$}               0               = 1 if and only if               r               = 0.},

  abstract = {Background: As in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia remains challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. Methods: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. Results: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. Conclusions: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.},

Our model implies that people cut back on consumption and work to reduce the chances of being infected. These decisions reduce the severity of the epidemic but exacerbate the size of the associated recession. The competitive equilibrium is not socially optimal because infected people do not fully internalize the effect of their economic decisions on the spread of the virus. In our benchmark model, the best simple containment policy increases the severity of the recession but saves roughly half a million lives in the United States.},

In spite of years of work to establish statewide staffing regulations, there is little evidence that the law was effective in attracting more nurses to the hospital workforce or improving patient outcomes. This paper examines the effects of this legislation on employment and wages of registered nurses. By using annual financial data from California hospitals, I show that nurse-to-patient ratios in medical/surgical units increased substantially following the staffing mandate. However, survey data from two nationally representative datasets indicate that the law had no effect on the aggregate number of registered nurses or the hours they worked in California hospitals, and at most a modest effect on wages. My findings suggest that offsetting changes in labor demand due to hospital closures, combined with reclassification of workers within hospitals, and mitigated the employment effects of California's staffing regulation. This paper cautions that California's experience with minimum nurse staffing legislation may not be generalizable to states considering similar policies in very different hospital markets.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Before the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), vaccination reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated persons who became infected, potentially by reducing viral loads. Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents transmission. METHODS We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and delta variants and time since the second vaccination. RESULTS Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 54,667 (37\%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In vaccinated index patients who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for the comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two ChAdOx1 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index patients explained 7 to 23\% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission. (Funded by the U.K. Government Department of Health and Social Care and others.).},

  abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about massive declines in wellbeing around the world. This paper seeks to quantify and compare two important components of those losses -- increased mortality and higher poverty -- using years of human life as a common metric. We estimate that almost 20 million life-years were lost to Covid-19 by December 2020. Over the same period and by the most conservative definition, over 120 million additional years were spent in poverty because of the pandemic. The mortality burden, whether estimated in lives or in years of life lost, increases sharply with GDP per capita. The poverty burden, on the contrary, declines with per capita national incomes when a constant absolute poverty line is used, or is uncorrelated with national incomes when a more relative approach is taken to poverty lines. In both cases the poverty burden of the pandemic, relative to the mortality burden, is much higher for poor countries. The distribution of aggregate welfare losses -- combining mortality and poverty and expressed in terms of life-years -- depends both on the choice of poverty line(s) and on the relative weights placed on mortality and poverty. With a constant absolute poverty line and a relatively low welfare weight on mortality, poorer countries are found to bear a greater welfare loss from the pandemic. When poverty lines are set differently for poor, middle and high-income countries and/or a greater welfare weight is placed on mortality, uppermiddle and rich countries suffer the most.},

In this paper we document some of the most glaring gender inequalities that have arisen in the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how social psychological theories and research---including work on gender stereotypes and roles, responses to threat, precarious masculinity, perceptions of risk, and backlash---can help to explain the roots of these inequalities. In doing so, we use a broad definition of gender and consider relevant intersections of identity. Finally, we present three key considerations for research on gender inequalities moving forward. Namely, the need for social psychologists to (a) challenge binary conceptualizations of gender, (b) broaden the focus of research on gender inequalities, and (c) adopt an intersectional lens to address systemic inequalities in the wake of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Abstract             COVID-19 as a disease mainly affects older people. However, the measures that governments have introduced to prevent the spread of the pandemic will mainly impact on the younger ones. The key challenges for countries are to respond to both: (1) reducing the spread of the pandemic and (2) managing its syndemic, psycho-social dimension. Governments should design cross-cutting measures to address both these dimensions, be sensitive to and targeting different groups to enable, on one hand, a new normal life with the virus for individuals, and on the other hand, to enable society to function normally. For that aim, countries have to establish effective monitoring and measuring of the situation in order to ensure appropriate, effective and targeted responses. PANDA is an example of a good practice in Slovenia. The PANDA findings indicate that there are differences between generations in perceptions of the pandemic, in vaccine acceptance and in pandemic experiences. Mental health for example is one of the most affected components of health status in individuals, with worse results for younger generations. For the age group 65 - 74 years, 9 \% are reporting depression symptoms and 13.5\% reporting problems in mental health, while for the 18 - 29 years group, 17.8\% are reporting depression symptoms and 28.5\% mental health problems. Even more serious are the differences we could observe in assessing the financial situation, with 34.4\% of the surveyed participants aged 18-29 years assessing their financial situation as worse in the last three months, compared to only 9.9\% of those in the age group 65-74. Observed intergenerational inequalities are bringing along the responsibility of the older members of the population to get vaccinated, not only to protect themselves and prevent the collapse of the health system, but also to enable younger generations to get their lives back to normal and allow them to live and eat, attend education and socialise normally.},

According to our model, a program spending \$60 billion up front to expand production capacity and supply-chain inputs for vaccines and \$5 billion annually thereafter would be sufficient to ensure production capacity to vaccinate 70\% of the global population against a new virus within six months. The program would generate an expected net present value (NPV) gain of more than \$500 billion over the status quo of delaying investment until a pandemic arrives. A program undertaken by the USA alone would generate an expected NPV gain of over \$60 billion.},

Social distancing, mask wearing and contact tracing have contributed to containing or at least mitigating the outbreak, but how public awareness influences the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches remains unclear. In this study, we developed a discrete compartment dynamic model to mimic and explore how media reporting and the strengthening containment strategies can help curb the spread of COVID-19 using Shaanxi Province, China, as a case study. The targeted model is parameterized based on multi-source data, including the cumulative number of confirmed cases, recovered individuals, the daily number of media-reporting items and the imported cases from the rest of China outside Shaanxi from January 23 to April 11, 2020. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of media reporting and imported cases on transmission. The results revealed that reducing the intensity of media reporting, which would result in a significant increasing of the contact rate and a sizable decreasing of the contact-tracing rate, could aggravate the outbreak severity by increasing the cumulative number of confirmed cases. It also demonstrated that diminishing the imported cases could alleviate the outbreak severity by reducing the length of the epidemic and the final size of the confirmed cases; conversely, delaying implementation of lockdown strategies could prolong the length of the epidemic and magnify the final size. These findings suggest that strengthening media coverage and timely implementing of lockdown measures can significantly reduce infection.{$<$}/p{$><$}/abstract{$>$}}

In global health, such evaluations typically apply a discount rate of 3\% for health outcomes and costs, mirroring guidance developed for high-income countries, notably the USA. The article investigates the suitability of these guidelines for global health [i.e. with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)] and seeks to identify best practice. Our analysis builds on an overview of the academic literature on discounting in health evaluations, existing academic or government-related guidelines on discounting, a review on discount rates applied in economic evaluations in global health, and cross-country macroeconomic data. The social discount rate generally applied in global health of 3\% annually is inconsistent with rates of economic growth experienced outside the most advanced economies. For low- and lower-middle-income countries, a discount rate of at least 5\% is more appropriate, and one around 4\% for upper-middle-income countries. Alternative approaches - e.g. motivated by the returns to alternative investments or by the cost of financing - could usefully be applied, dependent on policy context. The current practise could lead to systematic bias towards over-valuing the future costs and health benefits of interventions. For health economic evaluations in global health, guidelines on discounting need to be adapted to take account of the different economic contexts of LMICs.},

For the United States, VSL is estimated as approximately \$10 million, which implies the value of preventing 100,000 COVID-19 deaths is \$1 trillion. Is this value too large? There are reasons to think so. First, VSL is a marginal rate of substitution and the potential risk reductions are non-marginal. The standard VSL model implies the rate of substitution of wealth for risk reduction is smaller when the risk reduction is larger, but a closed-form solution calibrated to estimates of the income elasticity of VSL shows the rate of decline is modest until the value of a non-marginal risk reduction accounts for a substantial share of income; average individuals are predicted to be willing to spend more than half their income to reduce one-year mortality risk by 1 in 100. Second, mortality risk is concentrated among the elderly, for whom VSL may be smaller and who would benefit from a persistent risk reduction for a shorter period because of their shorter life expectancy. Third, the pandemic and responses to it have caused substantial losses in income that should decrease VSL. In contrast, VSL is plausibly larger for risks (like COVID-19) that are dreaded, uncertain, catastrophic, and ambiguous. These arguments are evaluated and key issues for improving estimates are highlighted.},

  institution = {OECD},
  abstract = {The worldwide school closures in early 2020 led to losses in learning that will not easily be made up for even if schools quickly return to their prior performance levels. These losses will have lasting economic impacts both on the affected students and on each nation unless they are effectively remediated. While the precise learning losses are not yet known, existing research suggests that the students in grades 1-12 affected by the closures might expect some 3 percent lower income over their entire lifetimes. For nations, the lower long-term growth related to such losses might yield an average of 1.5 percent lower annual GDP for the remainder of the century. These economic losses would grow if schools are unable to re-start quickly. The economic losses will be more deeply felt by disadvantaged students. All indications are that students whose families are less able to support out-of-school learning will face larger learning losses than their more advantaged peers, which in turn will translate into deeper losses of lifetime earnings. The present value of the economic losses to nations reach huge proportions. Just returning schools to where they were in 2019 will not avoid such losses. Only making them better can. While a variety of approaches might be attempted, existing research indicates that close attention to the modified re-opening of schools offers strategies that could ameliorate the losses. Specifically, with the expected increase in video-based instruction, matching the skills of the teaching force to the new range of tasks and activities could quickly move schools to heightened performance. Additionally, because the prior disruptions are likely to increase the variations in learning levels within individual classrooms, pivoting to more individualised instruction could leave all students better off as schools resume. As schools move to re-establish their programmes even as the pandemic continues, it is natural to focus considerable attention on the mechanics and logistics of safe re-opening. But the long-term economic impacts also require serious attention, because the losses already suffered demand more than the best of currently considered re-opening approaches.},

  abstract = {Economics can make immensely valuable contributions to our understanding of infectious disease transmission and the design of effective policy responses. The one unique charac? teristic of infectious diseases makes it also particularly complicated to analyze: the fact that it is transmitted from person to person. It explains why individuals' behavior and ex? ternalities are a central topic for the economics of infectious diseases. Many public health interventions are built on the assumption that individuals are altruistic and consider the benefits and costs of their actions to others. This would imply that even infected individu? als demand prevention, which stands in conflict with the economic theory of rational be? havior. Empirical evidence is conflicting for infected individuals. For healthy individuals, evidence suggests that the demand for prevention is affected by real or perceived risk of infection. However, studies are plagued by underreporting of preventive behavior and non-random selection into testing. Some empirical studies have shown that the impact of prevention interventions could be far greater than one case prevented, resulting in signif? icant externalities. Therefore, economic evaluations need to build on dynamic transmis? sion models in order to correctly estimate these externalities. Future research needs are significant. Economic research needs to improve our understanding of the role of human behavior in disease transmission; support the better integration of economic and epidemi? ological modeling, evaluation of large-scale public health interventions with quasi-experi? mental methods, design of optimal subsidies for tackling the global threat of antimicro? bial resistance, refocusing the research agenda toward underresearched diseases; and most importantly to assure that progress translates into saved lives on the ground by ad? vising on effective health system strengthening.},

Recently, several more efficient EVSI approximation methods have been developed. However, these approximation methods have not been compared, and therefore their comparative performance across different examples has not been explored. Methods. We compared 4 EVSI methods using 3 previously published health economic models. The examples were chosen to represent a range of real-world contexts, including situations with multiple study outcomes, missing data, and data from an observational rather than a randomized study. The computational speed and accuracy of each method were compared. Results. In each example, the approximation methods took minutes or hours to achieve reasonably accurate EVSI estimates, whereas the traditional Monte Carlo method took weeks. Specific methods are particularly suited to problems where we wish to compare multiple proposed sample sizes, when the proposed sample size is large, or when the health economic model is computationally expensive. Conclusions. As all the evaluated methods gave estimates similar to those given by traditional Monte Carlo, we suggest that EVSI can now be efficiently computed with confidence in realistic examples. No systematically superior EVSI computation method exists as the properties of the different methods depend on the underlying health economic model, data generation process, and user expertise.},

The presentation of multiple receptor-binding domains (RBDs) from evolutionarily-related viruses on a nanoparticle scaffold elicits a strong antibody response to conserved regions. Here we produce quartets of tandemly-linked RBDs from SARS-like betacoronaviruses coupled to the mi3 nanocage through a SpyTag/SpyCatcher spontaneous reaction. These Quartet Nanocages induce a high level of neutralizing antibodies against several different coronaviruses, including against viruses not represented on the vaccine. In animals primed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike, boost immunizations with Quartet Nanocages increased the strength and breadth of an otherwise narrow immune response. Quartet Nanocages are a strategy with potential to confer heterotypic protection against emergent zoonotic coronavirus pathogens and facilitate proactive pandemic protection.

  abstract = {Health impact simulation models are used to predict how a proposed policy or scenario will affect population health outcomes. These models represent the typically-complex systems that describe how the scenarios affect exposures to risk factors for disease or injury (e.g. air pollution or physical inactivity), and how these risk factors are related to measures of population health (e.g. expected survival). These models are informed by multiple sources of data, and are subject to multiple sources of uncertainty. We want to describe which sources of uncertainty contribute most to uncertainty about the estimate or decision arising from the model. Furthermore, we want to decide where further research should be focused to obtain further data to reduce this uncertainty, and what form that research might take. This article presents a tutorial in the use of Value of Information methods for uncertainty analysis and research prioritisation in health impact simulation models. These methods are based on Bayesian decision-theoretic principles, and quantify the expected benefits from further information of different kinds. The expected value of partial perfect information about a parameter measures sensitivity of a decision or estimate to uncertainty about that parameter. The expected value of sample information represents the expected benefit from a specific proposed study to get better information about the parameter. The methods are applicable both to situations where the model is used to make a decision between alternative policies, and situations where the model is simply used to estimate a quantity (such as expected gains in survival under a scenario). This paper explains how to calculate and interpret the expected value of information in the context of a simple model describing the health impacts of air pollution from motorised transport. We provide a general-purpose R package and full code to reproduce the example analyses.},

We suggest encouraging research and development based on innovative technologies linked to industries in healthcare, pharmaceutical, and biotech, promoting transformation of healthcare systems based on new technologies, providing access to quality health-care, promoting public healthcare providers, and investing in the development of regional healthcare infrastructure, as a tool of equal regional development based on economic assessment.

This paper quantitatively investigates the macroeconomic and dis-tributional consequences of school closures through intergenerational channels in the medium-and long-term.

We calibrate the stationary equilibrium of the model to the U.S. economy and compute the equilibrium responses following unexpected school closure shocks. We {\dots}nd that school closures have moderate long-lasting adverse e¤ects on macroeconomic aggregates such as output. In addition, we {\dots}nd that school closures reduce intergenerational mobility, especially among older children. Finally, we {\dots}nd that lower sub-stitutability between public and parental investments induces larger damages in the aggregate economy and overall lifetime incomes of the a¤ected children, while mitigating negative impacts on intergenerational mobility. In all {\dots}ndings, heterogeneous parental responses to school closures play a key role. Our results provide a quantitatively relevant dimension to consider for policymakers assessing potential costs of school closures.},

  abstract = {Background: To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a ``lockdown'' was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the ``lockdown'' to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Findings: We found a 73\% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95\% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only.},

  abstract = {Background               Tuberculosis (TB) imposes a substantial health and economic burden on many populations and countries, but lack of funding has significantly contributed to several countries falling short of global TB reduction targets. Furthermore, existing assessments of the economic impact of TB do not capture the impacts on productivity and economic growth or the pathways by which epidemiology, demography, and the economy interact. Evidence is needed to answer how investment in treatment and control measures may help to mitigate the twin Indian health and macroeconomic burdens of TB over the coming decades.                                         Methods and findings               We develop a fully integrated dynamic macroeconomic-health-demographic simulation model for India, the country with the largest national TB burden, and use it to estimate the macroeconomic return to investment in TB treatment.               Our estimated results indicate that, over 2021 to 2040, the health and macroeconomic burdens of TB in India will include over 62.4m incident cases, 8.1m TB-related deaths and a cumulative gross domestic product (GDP) loss of US\$146.4bn. Low-income households will bear larger health and relative economic burdens while larger absolute economic burdens will fall on high-income households. Achieving the World Health Organisation's End TB target of 90\% case detection could reduce clinical and demographic disease burdens by 75\% to 89\% and reduce the macroeconomic burden by US\$120.2bn. Developing a 95\% effective pan-TB treatment regimen would reduce the same burdens by 25\% to 31\% and US\$35.3bn, respectively, while less effective but immediately achievable scaling-up of existing treatment regimens would reduce burdens by 20\% to 25\% and US\$28.4bn, respectively. If an increase in case detection to 90\% could be combined with 95\% effective pan-TB treatment, it could reduce clinical and demographic disease burdens by 78\% to 91\% and reduce the macroeconomic burden by US\$124.2bn.               In order to develop this complex integrated model framework, some aspects of the epidemiological model were simplified such that the model does not capture, for example, separate modelling of drug susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cases or separate public/private healthcare provision. However, future iterations of the model could address these limitations.                                         Conclusions               In this study, we find that even our least effective, but most accessible, revised TB treatment regimen has the potential to generate US\$28bn in GDP gains. Clearly, the economic gains of increasing case detection rates and implementing improved TB treatment regimens hinges on both the feasibility and timeframe over which they can be achieved in practice. Nevertheless, the revised TB treatment regimen is readily accessible, and our results therefore demonstrate that there is room for undertaking substantial additional investment in control and treatment of TB in India, in order to reduce the suffering of TB patients while maintaining acceptable provision of resourcing elsewhere in the Indian economy.},

  abstract = {Since its emergence in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused hundreds of millions of cases and continues to circulate globally. To establish a novel SARS-CoV-2 human challenge model that enables controlled investigation of pathogenesis, correlates of protection and efficacy testing of forthcoming interventions, 36 volunteers aged 18--29 years without evidence of previous infection or vaccination were inoculated with 10 TCID50 of a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-2/human/GBR/484861/2020) intranasally in an open-label, non-randomized study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04865237; funder, UK Vaccine Taskforce). After inoculation, participants were housed in a high-containment quarantine unit, with 24-hour close medical monitoring and full access to higher-level clinical care. The study's primary objective was to identify an inoculum dose that induced well-tolerated infection in more than 50\% of participants, with secondary objectives to assess virus and symptom kinetics during infection. All pre-specified primary and secondary objectives were met. Two participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis owing to seroconversion between screening and inoculation, identified post hoc. Eighteen ({\textasciitilde}53\%) participants became infected, with viral load (VL) rising steeply and peaking at {\textasciitilde}5 days after inoculation. Virus was first detected in the throat but rose to significantly higher levels in the nose, peaking at {\textasciitilde}8.87 log10 copies per milliliter (median, 95\% confidence interval (8.41, 9.53)). Viable virus was recoverable from the nose up to {\textasciitilde}10 days after inoculation, on average. There were no serious adverse events. Mild-to-moderate symptoms were reported by 16 (89\%) infected participants, beginning 2--4 days after inoculation, whereas two (11\%) participants remained asymptomatic (no reportable symptoms). Anosmia or dysosmia developed more slowly in 15 (83\%) participants. No quantitative correlation was noted between VL and symptoms, with high VLs present even in asymptomatic infection. All infected individuals developed serum spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Results from lateral flow tests were strongly associated with viable virus, and modeling showed that twice-weekly rapid antigen tests could diagnose infection before 70--80\% of viable virus had been generated. Thus, with detailed characterization and safety analysis of this first SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study in young adults, viral kinetics over the course of primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 were established, with implications for public health recommendations and strategies to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Future studies will identify the immune factors associated with protection in those participants who did not develop infection or symptoms and define the effect of prior immunity and viral variation on clinical outcome.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study examined the association between BMI and clinical outcomes among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Methods: A total of 10,861 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Northwell Health system hospitals between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020, were included in this study. BMI was classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity classes I, II, and III. Primary outcomes were invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. Results: A total of 243 (2.2\%) patients were underweight, 2,507 (23.1\%) were normal weight, 4,021 (37.0\%) had overweight, 2,345 (21.6\%) had obesity class I, 990 (9.1\%) had obesity class II, and 755 (7.0\%) had obesity class III. Patients who had overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27 [95\% CI: 1.11-1.46]), obesity class I (OR = 1.48 [95\% CI: 1.27-1.72]), obesity class II (OR = 1.89 [95\% CI: 1.56-2.28]), and obesity class III (OR = 2.31 [95\% CI: 1.88-2.85]) had an increased risk of requiring IMV. Underweight and obesity classes II and III were statistically associated with death (OR = 1.44 [95\% CI: 1.08-1.92]; OR = 1.25 [95\% CI: 1.03-1.52]; OR = 1.61 [95\% CI: 1.30-2.00], respectively). Among patients who were on IMV, BMI was not associated with inpatient deaths. Conclusions: Patients who are underweight or who have obesity are at risk for mechanical ventilation and death, suggesting that pulmonary complications (indicated by IMV) are a significant contributor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 infection.},

This allows us for the first time to use one coherent data set for the estimation process. Furthermore, it gives us the opportunity to derive elasticities from the same data which researchers can use to calibrate their models. On the basis of our estimations, we demonstrate that the practice of using Cobb--Douglas or Leontief production functions in economic models must be rejected for the majority of sectors. We provide a comprehensive set of estimated substitution elasticities covering a wide range of sectors. Our results suggest that no substantial change in input substitutability takes place during the time period we consider. Moreover, there is no substantial variation in substitution elasticities across regions.},

  abstract = {Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are a standard tool for policy analysis and forecasts of economic growth. Unfortunately, due to computational constraints, many CGE models are dimensionally small, aggregating countries into an often limited set of regions or using assumptions such as static price-level expectations, where next period's price is conditional only on current or past prices. This is a concern for climate change modeling, since the effects of global warming by country, in a fully disaggregated and global trade model, are needed, and the known future effects of global warming should be included in forward-looking forecasts for prices and profitability. This work extends a large dimensional intertemporal CGE trade model to account for the various effects of global warming (e.g., loss in agricultural productivity, sea level rise, and health effects) on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and levels for 139 countries, by decade and over the long term, where producers look forward and adjust price expectations and capital stocks to account for future climate effects. The potential economic gains from complying with the Paris Accord are also estimated, showing that even with a limited set of possible damages from global warming, these gains are substantial. For example, with the comparative case of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (4{$^\circ$}C), the global gains from complying with the 2{$^\circ$}C target (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) are approximately US\$17,489 billion per year in the long run (year 2100).

  abstract = {A ``poverty trap'' can be understood as a set of self-reinforcing mechanisms whereby countries start poor and remain poor: poverty begets poverty, so that current poverty is itself a direct cause of poverty in the future. The idea of a poverty trap has this striking implication for policy: much poverty is needless, in the sense that a different equilibrium is possible and one-time policy efforts to break the poverty trap may have lasting effects. But what does the modern evidence suggest about the extent to which poverty traps exist in practice and the underlying mechanisms that may be involved? The main mechanisms we examine include S-shaped savings functions at the country level; ``big-push'' theories of development based on coordination failures; hunger-based traps which rely on physical work capacity rising nonlinearly with food intake at low levels; and occupational poverty traps whereby poor individuals who start businesses that are too small will be trapped earning subsistence returns. We conclude that these types of poverty traps are rare and largely limited to remote or otherwise disadvantaged areas. We discuss behavioral poverty traps as a recent area of research, and geographic poverty traps as the most likely form of a trap. The resulting policy prescriptions are quite different from the calls for a big push in aid or an expansion of microfinance. The more-likely poverty traps call for action in less-traditional policy areas such as promoting more migration.},

This study aimed to determine whether individuals with obesity compared to individuals with normal weight have an increased risk for severe COVID-19. We conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library and critically reviewed the secondary literature using AMSTAR-2. We explored 27 studies. Findings indicate that individuals with obesity (body mass index\,{$\geq$}\,30\,kg/m(2) ), as compared to individuals without obesity, experience an increased risk for hospitalization (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40-2.45), admission to the intensive care unit (OR: 1.30-2.32), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.47-2.63), and the composite outcome 'severe outcome' (OR or risk ratio: 1.62-4.31). We found diverging results concerning death to COVID-19, but data trended towards increased mortality. Comparing individuals with obesity to individuals without obesity, findings suggested younger individuals ({$<$}60\,years) experience a higher risk of severe disease compared to older individuals ({$\geq$}60\,years). Obesity augments the severity of COVID-19 including a tendency to increased mortality and, thus, contributes to an increased disease burden, especially among younger individuals.},

In this study, we introduce a deterministic SEIR model considering the behavior-changed susceptible group to investigate the effect of the speed and intensity of behavioral change on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We used epidemiological data from South Korea and Italy for the simulation study, because South Korea and Italy were the first countries to report an outbreak of COVID-19 after China and the prevention and response policy of each government were similar during the first outbreak of COVID-19. Simulation results showed that it took approximately twenty fewer days in Korea than in Italy until 90\% of susceptible individuals changed their behavior during the first outbreak. It was observed that the behavior-changed susceptible individuals reduced the COVID-19 transmission rate by up to 93\% in Korea and 77\% in Italy. Furthermore, if the intensity and speed of behavioral change in Italy were the same as in Korea, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been reduced by approximately 95\%, from 210,700 to 10,700, until the end of the lockdown period. We assumed that behavioral change is influenced by the number of confirmed cases and does not take into account social and cultural differences, as well as the state of the healthcare system, between the two countries. Our mathematical modeling showed how important the high intensity and fast speed of behavioral change to reduce the number of confirmed cases in the early period of an epidemic are.},

Moreover, the negative effects of pandemics are economically contagious-indirect effects on own-country GDP from affected trading partners are significant for both the initial GDP decline and the positive bounce back. However, the negative effects on GDP and unemployment are felt less in countries with larger first-year responses in government spending, especially on health care. Our estimates imply that the impact effect of the Covid-19 shock on world GDP growth is approximately four standard deviations worse than the average past pandemic.},

  abstract = {Epidemics and pandemics pose a sporadic and sometimes severe threat to human health. How should policymakers prioritize preventing and preparing for such events, relative to other needs? To answer this question, we used computational epidemiology and extreme events modeling simulations to estimate the risk of future mortality from low frequency, high severity epidemics and pandemics in two important categories-respiratory diseases (in particular those caused by pandemic influenza viruses and novel coronaviruses) and viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) such as Ebola and Marburg virus diseases. We estimate a global annual average of 2.5 million deaths, attributed to respiratory pandemics. We estimate an annual average of 26,000 VHF deaths globally, 72 percent of which would be in Africa. Annual averages conceal vast year by year variation, and the reported analyses convey that variation-as well as variation across regions and by age. Our estimates suggest that both the frequency and severity of such events is higher than previously believed-and this is likely to be a lower bound estimate given the focus of this chapter on deaths caused by a subset of pathogens. Our simulations suggest that an event having the mortality level of COVID-19 should not be considered a "once in a century" risk, but rather occurring with an annual probability of 2-3 percent (that is, a one in 33-50-year event). Despite the substantial uncertainty in heavy-tail distributions, policymakers can use these estimates to develop risk-informed financing, prevention, preparedness, and response plans.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background             The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in over 20.5 million confirmed cases and 175,000 deaths in England by December 2023. The pandemic's impact varied significantly across different population groups, influenced by deprivation, ethnicity, and policy measures.                                   Methods                            We analysed individual-level data on SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospitalisations, deaths, and vaccination records in England from May 2020 to February 2022. We used Poisson regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for first pillar 2 PCR positive cases, associated hospitalisations, and deaths, adjusting for sex, ethnicity, deprivation, geographic region, age, and epidemiological week. Model selection was based on cross-validation and performance metrics (AIC, R               2               ).                                                Findings             The data analysed included 12,310,485 first SARS-CoV-2 pillar 2 PCR-confirmed infections, 79,315 hospitalisations, and 107,823 deaths associated with the first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant differences were observed across IMD quintiles, with the most deprived areas showing higher incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for death (1.64, 95\% CI: 1.60-1.67) and hospitalisation (1.80, 95\% CI: 1.75-1.85) compared to the least deprived areas as the reference group for the entire study period. Ethnic disparities were also notable, with higher IRRs for death and hospitalisation for all non-White ethnicities relative to White ethnicities as the reference group. We note that the magnitude of IRRs, for both deprivation and ethnicities, declined from the wild-type to the omicron periods for severe outcomes. For cases, we observed IRRs above one for non-White ethnicities during the wild-type and alpha periods only. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was also assessed, with models indicating a significant reduction in risk post-vaccination across all outcomes of interest.                                   Interpretation             Deprivation and ethnicity significantly influenced COVID-19 outcomes in England. For severe outcomes, pre-existing health inequalities lead to large and persistent disparities. For infections, both protective and support measures need to be structured with ethnicity and deprivation in mind in the early parts of a pandemic.                                   Funding             UK Medical Research Council, Schmidt Foundation, National Institute of Health Research, Community Jameel.                                   Research in Context                            Evidence before this study                                The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, and previous research has highlighted the role of socioeconomic factors, such as deprivation and ethnicity, in influencing outcomes. McGowan et al. found in a scoping review that 91\% of studies showed significantly higher COVID-19 mortality in areas of social disadvantage relative to more affluent areas. A systematic review by Pan et al.                 2                 showed the impact of ethnicity on clinical outcomes in COVID-19. However, the impact of deprivation and ethnicity over different time periods of the COVID-19 pandemic and its interplay with public health measures is poorly understood.                                                        Added value of this study               This study leverages extensive data from multiple sources, including PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalisation records, death registries, and vaccination databases, to comprehensively analyse COVID-19 outcomes in relation to deprivation and ethnicity across England. Using Poisson regression, we provide estimates of incidence rate ratios (IRR) associated with different levels of deprivation and ethnic backgrounds. This study also incorporates data on periods defined by dominant variants and public health measures, allowing for a more detailed examination of how these factors interact with local socioeconomic contexts to influence health outcomes.                                         Implications of all the available evidence               The findings underscore the importance of considering disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by deprivation and ethnicity and highlight the need for targeted strategies to address these inequalities. Policymakers should prioritise resource allocation and tailored interventions in high-risk areas to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of vaccination programs should be continuously evaluated in the context of these socioeconomic determinants to enhance their efficacy and reach. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the need for an equitable public health response that addresses the specific needs of diverse populations across different localities before the pandemic by reducing health inequalities and in the pandemic response.},

  abstract = {Background: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. Methods and Findings: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies. {\copyright} 2008 Mossong et al.},

Relative to a scenario without the pandemic (the               No COVID               scenario), the               COVID Base               scenario increases global extreme poverty by 73.9 million in 2020 (the range across all scenarios: 43.5 to 155.0 million), 63.6 million in 2030 (range: 9.8 to 167.2 million) and 57.1 million in 2050 (range: 3.1 to 163.0 million). The               COVID Base               results in seven more countries not meeting the SDG1 target by 2030 that would have achieved the target in a               No COVID               scenario. The most pessimistic scenario results in 17 more countries not achieving SDG1 compared with a               No COVID               scenario.

Extreme Event Attribution (EEA), a methodology that examines how anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions had changed the occurrence of specific extreme weather events, allows us to quantify the climate change-induced component of these costs. We collect data from all available EEA studies, combine these with data on the socio-economic costs of these events and extrapolate for missing data to arrive at an estimate of the global costs of extreme weather attributable to climate change in the last twenty years. We find that US                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}\$\$\$                                        \$                                                                  143 billion per year of the costs of extreme events is attributable to climatic change. The majority (63\%), of this is due to human loss of life. Our results suggest that the frequently cited estimates of the economic costs of climate change arrived at by using Integrated Assessment Models may be substantially underestimated.},

In this survey, we examine the impact of the outbreak on the Indonesian economy, as well as the government's response to the public health crisis and its provisions for the emerging economic crisis. Indonesia's delay in responding to the health crisis while Covid-19 spread in neighbouring countries in January--February 2020 has been costly for the health of the population. The government's policy responses have so far been aimed at steadying the ship, addressing both the needs of the poor and the potentially poor (vulnerable) groups. At the time of writing, Covid-19 had not been tamed in Indonesia by any means. Hence, its implications for economic growth, jobs and welfare remained uncertain, as policy discussions were all about opening up the economy from virus-imposed restrictions across the country, under what has been termed the `new normal'.},

The review examines the case for revision or retention of current methods. The changes considered include eliminating favourable rates in certain special cases and the reduction of the base-case rate for costs and health effects from 3.5 to 1.5\%. The review also notes the potential need to reduce the cost-effectiveness threshold to accommodate a discount rate reduction, explaining that an agreement between the UK government and the pharmaceutical industry proscribes changing NICE's threshold range until the end of 2023. We believe NICE should be commended for a useful overview of the existing literature and relevant issues. We firmly endorse NICE's view that favourable discount rates are not a good way to apply a preference for certain interventions. Similarly, we support the option of reducing the discount rate to 1.5\%, which better accords with real government borrowing costs. We suggest further work to clarify the appropriate theoretical basis for the NICE's social discount rate and the sensitivity of the threshold to changes in discounting. The prospects of a necessary discount rate reduction appear to depend on whether a threshold reduction can be achieved within NICE's current range or if the range itself must be revised downwards. NICE has usefully informed the debate around discount rates. Ultimately, the path to a methodologically consistent and evidence-based revision of discounting depends on whether NICE needs to adjust the threshold too and if it is free to do so.},

Next, it makes a strong case for the adoption of modelling-based approaches to inform policy-making, with an emphasis on integrated models that merge epidemiological and economic considerations in a changing and uncertain environment.

Instead, we suggest a different possibility: that food choices are structurally conditioned by income inequality, first; and, second, that we eat what huge oligopolistic food producers and distributors have on offer, which is in turn shaped or facilitated by neoliberal state intervention. To highlight the relevance of structural factors, we develop an index that measures the risk of exposure to what we call the ``neoliberal diet'' for low-to-middle-income working classes. Using this index, we compare the United States and Canada, advanced capitalist countries that are also agro-export powerhouses, with a group of countries including the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) plus Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey. We conclude that state interventions need to refocus on reducing social inequality and the social determinants of food production and distribution. Transcending individualistic and consumption approaches will help us appreciate that the state, not the individual consumer, is best positioned to implement change when it comes to food ``choices'' and food production.},

  abstract = {Despite uncertainty being intrinsic to economic evaluation of health care, existing techniques for handling uncertainty remain underdeveloped compared to the formal techniques commonly applied in the business sector. This paper develops an alternative approach to handling uncertainty in economic evaluation based on the quantification of uncertainty using `option pricing' techniques. The central feature of option pricing is that investments are rarely `now or never' propositions. The presence of uncertainty and the degree of irreversibility of a decision makes it clear that some flexibility in the timing of a decision is often a desirable characteristic with an economic value. We demonstrate how, with modification, option pricing techniques can be applied to the decision rules for economic evaluation, illustrating how the presence of even modest degrees of uncertainty can give rise to substantial changes in the investment criterion for economic evaluation. The paper concludes by identifying the key determinants of the `option value', namely the presence and type of uncertainty; the ability to defer a decision; and the irreversibility of the decision. The relative significance of each of these key determinants on the decision rules for economic evaluation will depend on the particular characteristics of the technology under consideration.},

The review shows that the private average global rate of return to one extra year of schooling is about 9 percent a year and very stable over decades. Private returns to higher education have increased over time, raising issues of financing and equity. Social returns to schooling remain high, above 10 percent at the secondary and higher education levels. Women continue to experience higher average rates of return to schooling, showing that girls' education remains a priority. Returns are higher in low-income countries. Those employed in the private sector of the economy enjoy higher returns than those in the public sector, lending support to the productive value of education.}

Early reviews of the first wave of lockdowns and school closures suggested significant learning loss in a few countries. A more recent and thorough analysis of recorded learning loss evidence documented since the beginning of the school closures between March 2020 and March 2022 finds even more evidence of learning loss. Most studies observed increases in inequality where certain demographics of students experienced learning losses more significant than others. But there are also outliers, countries that managed to limit the amount of loss. This review aims to consolidate all available evidence and documents the empirical findings. In fact, 36 robust studies were identified, the majority of which find learning losses, on average amounting to 0.17 of a standard deviation, equivalent to roughly a 1/2 years' worth of learning. These findings confirm that learning loss is real and significant, even compared to the first year. Further work is needed to increase the quantity of studies produced, and to ascertain the reasons for learning loss and in a few cases mitigation of loss.},

The paper argues that the more prevention of infectious disease responds to prevalence in this manner, the less it responds to price, thereby lowering the role of Pigouvian price subsidies and other demand-stimulating public health measures aimed at solving the under-provision of vaccines and other preventive efforts with positive external effects.}

This disparity in access has been one of the greatest failures of international cooperation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Global COVID-19 vaccine inequity affects us all, with ongoing risk of new variants emerging until global herd immunity is strengthened. The current model of global vaccine distribution is based on financial competition for limited vaccine supplies, resulting in HICs getting first access to vaccines, with LICs being forced to rely on voluntary donations through schemes like COVAX. Pharmaceutical companies own the intellectual property (IP) rights for COVID-19 vaccines, allowing them to control manufacturing, distribution, and pricing. However, the pharmaceutical industry did not develop these vaccines alone, with billions of dollars of public funding being instrumental in their discovery and development. Solutions to enable global equitable access already exist. The next step in scale up of manufacture and distribution worldwide is equitable knowledge sharing and technology transfer. The World Health Organization centralized technology transfer hub would facilitate international cooperation. Investments made into developing this infrastructure benefit the COVID-19 response whilst promoting future pandemic preparedness. Whilst globally there is majority support for waivers of IP to facilitate this next step, key opponents blocking this move include the UK and other European countries which host large domestic pharmaceutical industries. A nationalistic approach is not effective during a global pandemic. International cooperation is essential to achieve global goals against COVID-19.}

Some countries still have key subpopulations facing hunger and undernutrition defined by stunting or extreme thinness among adults. We call these double burden of malnutrition countries.

With great political and civil society commitment to adoption of policies shown in other countries to have improved dietary choices and social norms around foods, we can arrest and even reverse the rapid shift to diets dominated by a stage of high ultra-processed food intake and increasing prevalence of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.},

  abstract = {Social distancing requirements associated with COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to school closures. In mid-April, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization reported that 192 countries had closed all schools and universities, affecting more than 90 percent of the world's learners: 1.5 billion children and young people. The closures are expected to reduce learning and will lead to future losses in earnings and labor productivity. Schooling attainment leads to increased earnings. What is not known is how much earnings will decline due to the school closures. Starting with the fact that every year of schooling equates to 8-9 percent in additional future earnings, this paper uses the number of months of education closures to estimate the loss in marginal future earnings. The findings show that the school closures reduce future earnings, and this loss is equivalent to 15 percent of future gross domestic product. The school closures will have a large and long-lasting impact on the earnings of future workers. It is also likely that students from low-income countries will be affected most. These estimates are conservative, assuming that the closures will end after four months and school quality will not suffer.}

  abstract = {Background               School closures have been a prominent component of the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response. However, their effect on viral transmission, COVID-19 mortality and health care system pressure remains incompletely understood, as traditional observational studies fall short in assessing such population-level impacts.                                         Methods and findings               We used a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 epidemics of 74 countries, incorporating observed data from 2020 to 2022 and historical school closure timelines. We then simulated a counterfactual scenario, assuming that schools remained open throughout the study period. We compared the simulated epidemics in terms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, deaths, and hospital occupancy pressure. We estimated that school closures achieved moderate to significant burden reductions in most settings over the period 2020 to 2022. They reduced peak hospital occupancy pressure in nearly all countries, with 72 out of 74 countries (97\%) showing a positive median estimated effect, and median estimated effect ranging from reducing peak hospital occupancy pressure by 89\% in Brazil to increasing it by 19\% in Indonesia. The median estimated effect of school closures on COVID-19 deaths ranged from a 73\% reduction in Thailand to a 7\% increase in the United Kingdom. We estimated that school closures may have increased overall COVID-19 mortality (based on median estimates) in 9 countries (12\%), including several European nations and Indonesia. This is attributed to changes in population-level immunity dynamics, leading to a concentration of the epidemic during the Delta variant period, alongside an upward shift in the age distribution of infections. While our estimates were associated with significant uncertainty, our sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of social mixing assumptions revealed robustness in our country-specific conclusions. The main study limitations include the fact that analyses were conducted at the national level, whereas school closure policies often varied by region. Furthermore, some regions, including Africa, were underrepresented due to insufficient data informing the model.                                         Conclusions               Our analysis revealed nuanced effects of school closures on COVID-19 dynamics, with reductions in COVID-19 impacts in most countries but negative epidemiological effects in a few others. We identified critical mechanisms for consideration in future policy decisions, highlighting the unpredictable nature of emerging variants and potential shifts in infection demographics associated with school closures.},

These estimates (typically expressed as the value per statistical life, VSL) describe the willingness of those affected by a policy to exchange their own income for the risk reductions they experience. While these values are relatively well studied in high-income countries, less is known about the values held by lower-income populations. We identify 26 studies conducted in the 172 countries considered low- or middle-income in any of the past 20 years; several have significant limitations. Thus there are few or no direct estimates of VSL for most such countries. Instead, analysts typically extrapolate values from wealthier countries, adjusting only for income differences. This extrapolation requires selecting a base value and an income elasticity that summarizes the rate at which VSL changes with income. Because any such approach depends on assumptions of uncertain validity, we recommend that analysts conduct a standardized sensitivity analysis to assess the extent to which their conclusions change depending on these estimates. In the longer term, more research on the value of mortality risk reductions in low- and middle-income countries is essential.},

We review these studies, focusing on those that estimate values for both adults and children using a consistent approach to limit the effects of between-study variability. We rely on explicit selection criteria to identify studies that measure reasonably comparable outcomes and are candidates for application to analyses of U.S. policies. The ratio of values for children to values for adults ranges from 0.6 to 2.9; however, most estimates are greater than 1.5. Although some studies suggest that the divergence between child and adult values decreases as the child ages, this finding is not universal. We conclude that analysts should test the sensitivity of their results to the use of higher values for children than adults. Additional empirical research is needed to support more precise estimates of the variation in values by age that can be featured in the primary analysis.},

If not well conducted and clearly reported, however, these studies can lead to erroneous conclusions.

Recognizing these challenges, the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation is supporting the development of reference case guidelines.

The available UK data suggests that most transmission occurs in household settings, with frequency related to social interactions within households. However, where most people acquire infection, may not be the most important issue in terms of controlling spread. Key factors in limiting onward transmission are who seeds the household setting, and where this index case acquired infection? Data sources for gaining a better understanding of where people acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection are contact tracing, household studies and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the virus, to ascertain who infects whom. Data sources and publications on these topics are limited at present in the UK. Data are limited in the UK on where index cases in households acquire infection, but the information collated by Public Health England (PHE) suggest that much heterogeneity pertains, depending on a variety of social and demographic factors. Activity related to shopping and social gatherings in restaurants and pubs generate the most infections, although many other factors have influence. Given data limitations-this observation should be treated with caution. The role of test, trace and isolate in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic The test, trace and isolate (TTI) system as a tool to control spread, and as a source of epidemiological information, has limitations when viral spread is extensive given the enormous workload involved in tracing contacts. It is best employed to control transmission during phases when rates of infection are low, as well illustrated in many East Asian countries. An illustration of the challenges facing TTI in the UK is provided by data collected in the first week of November 2020. Of those estimated by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) to have been infected that week, only 30\% were reached to ask for information on close contacts, and only 18\% of the estimated close contacts of those newly infected that week were asked to self-isolate. Perhaps only 9\% of these contacts did so fully, due to reported poor compliance issues in certain demographic and social groups. These numbers are clearly far too low to have a major impact on viral transmission or to provide a representative national picture of spread and control measure impact.}

  abstract = {Objective To quantify the current weight of evidence of the association between overweight and obesity as risk factors for COVID-19-related hospitalisations (including hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation) and death, and to assess the magnitude of the association and the potential dose--response relationships. Design PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, WHO COVID-19 database and Google Scholar were used to identify articles published up to 20 July 2021. Peer-reviewed studies reporting adjusted estimates of the association between overweight or obesity and COVID-19 outcomes were included. Three authors reviewed the articles and agreed. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the combined effects. Results A total of 208 studies with 3 550 997 participants from over 32 countries were included in this meta-analysis. Being overweight was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.28, n=21 studies), but not death (OR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.13, n=21). However, patients with obesity were at increased risk of both COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.62 to 1.84, n=58) and death (OR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.32, n=77). Similarly, patients with extreme obesity were at increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 2.53, 95\% CI 1.67 to 3.84, n=12) and death (OR 2.06, 95\% CI 1.76 to 3.00, n=19). There was a linear dose--response relationship between these obesity categories and COVID-19 outcomes, but the strength of the association has decreased over time. Conclusion Being overweight increases the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisations but not death, while obesity and extreme obesity increase the risk of both COVID-19-related hospitalisations and death. These findings suggest that prompt access to COVID-19 care, prioritisation for COVID-19 vaccination and other preventive measures are warranted for this vulnerable group.

  abstract = {Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has been an enormous shock to mortality, economies, and daily life. But what has received insufficient attention is the impact of the pandemic on the accumulation of human capital---the health, education, and skills---of young people. How large was the setback, and how far are we still from a recovery? Collapse and Recovery estimates the impacts of the pandemic on the human capital of young children, school-age children, and youth and discusses the urgent actions needed to reverse the damage. It shows that there was a collapse of human capital and that, unless that collapse is remedied, it is a time bomb for countries. Specifically, the report documents alarming declines in cognitive and social-emotional development among young children, which could translate into a 25 percent reduction in their earnings as adults. It finds that 1 billion children in low- and middle-income countries missed at least one year of in-person schooling. And despite enormous efforts in remote learning, children did not learn during the unprecedentedly long school closures, which could reduce future lifetime earnings around the world by US\$21 trillion. The report quantifies the dramatic drops in employment and skills among youth that resulted from the pandemic as well as the substantial increase in the number of youth neither employed nor enrolled in education or training. In all of these age groups, the impacts of the pandemic were consistently worse for children from poorer backgrounds. These losses call for immediate action. The good news is that evidence-based policies can recover these losses. Collapse and Recovery reviews governments' responses to the pandemic, assessing why there was a collapse in human capital accumulation, what was missing in the policy architecture to protect human capital during the crisis, and how governments can better prepare to withstand future shocks. It offers concrete policy recommendations to recover losses in human capital---programs that will end up paying for themselves in the long term. To better prepare for future shocks such as climate change and wars, the report emphasizes the need for solutions that bring health, education, and social protection programs together in an integrated human development system. If countries fail to act, the losses in human capital documented in this report will become permanent and last for multiple generations. The time to act is now.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the temporal dynamics of infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for understanding the spread of COVID-19 and for evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Many studies have estimated the infectiousness profile using observed serial intervals. However, statistical and epidemiological biases could lead to underestimation of the duration of infectiousness. We correct for these biases by curating data from the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China (when mitigation was minimal), and find that the infectiousness profile of the original strain is longer than previously thought. Sensitivity analysis shows our results are robust to model structure, assumed growth rate and potential observational biases. Although unmitigated transmission data is lacking for variants of concern (VOCs), previous analyses suggest that the alpha and delta variants have faster within-host kinetics, which we extrapolate to crude estimates of variant-specific unmitigated generation intervals. Knowing the unmitigated infectiousness profile of infected individuals can inform estimates of the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine measures. The framework presented here can help design better quarantine policies in early stages of future epidemics.},

We developed an agent-based simulation model and used data from the state of Georgia to explore the influence of viral mutation and seasonal effects on the course of an influenza pandemic. We showed that when a pandemic begins in April certain conditions can lead to a second wave in autumn (e.g. the degree of seasonality exceeding 030, or the daily rate of immunity loss exceeding 1\% per day). Moreover, certain combinations of seasonality and mutation variables reproduced three-wave epidemic curves. Our results may offer insights to public health officials on how to predict the subsequent course of an epidemic or pandemic based on early and emerging viral and epidemic characteristics and what data may be important to gather.

  abstract = {In March 2020 the South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium was formed to support government planning for COVID-19 cases and related healthcare. Models were developed jointly by local disease modelling groups to estimate cases, resource needs and deaths due to COVID-19. The National COVID-19 Epi Model (NCEM) while initially developed as a deterministic compartmental model of SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the nine provinces of South Africa, was adapted several times over the course of the first wave of infection in response to emerging local data and changing needs of government. By the end of the first wave, the NCEM had developed into a stochastic, spatially-explicit compartmental transmission model to estimate the total and reported incidence of COVID-19 across the 52 districts of South Africa. The model adopted a generalised Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed structure that accounted for the clinical profile of SARS-COV-2 (asymptomatic, mild, severe and critical cases) and avenues of treatment access (outpatient, and hospitalisation in non-ICU and ICU wards). Between end-March and early September 2020, the model was updated 11 times with four key releases to generate new sets of projections and scenario analyses to be shared with planners in the national and provincial Departments of Health, the National Treasury and other partners. Updates to model structure included finer spatial granularity, limited access to treatment, and the inclusion of behavioural heterogeneity in relation to the adoption of Public Health and Social Measures. These updates were made in response to local data and knowledge and the changing needs of the planners. The NCEM attempted to incorporate a high level of local data to contextualise the model appropriately to address South Africa's population and health system characteristics that played a vital role in producing and updating estimates of resource needs, demonstrating the importance of harnessing and developing local modelling capacity.},

Much depends on the policy response - a strong and well-designed response could contain the medium-term output losses, but large and enduring damage is a risk. ▪ Growth patterns after significant GDP declines vary. Historical evidence points to large upfront effects from pandemics and natural disasters, but the medium-term outcomes are mixed, with policy responses a crucial determinant. Longer recessions and financial crises tend to lead to weaker medium-term growth. ▪ The coronavirus may trigger annual GDP declines among the worst seen in the last 100 years. Economies can bounce back sharply after such declines, but our analysis suggests output losses also endure in a significant number of cases. ▪ The US interwar experience shows the danger of allowing financial distress to snowball and exacerbate GDP declines. The weakness of medium-term growth after the global financial crisis confirms the long-term impact of such distress. ▪ A key risk for the medium term is that firms and/or households react to the coronavirus recession and disruption by raising savings, accelerating a shift toward `Japanification' of major economies. ▪ Our baseline forecasts envisage moderate medium-term output losses due to coronavirus, in part reflecting rapid and large-scale policy interventions. But uncertainty around this forecast is significant and considerable variation is possible across economies.}

The specific inequities and other factors within megacities that affect vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality remain poorly defined. We assessed individual, community-level and healthcare factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality in a megacity of Jakarta, Indonesia, during two epidemic waves spanning 2 March 2020 to 31 August 2021.                                         Methods               This retrospective cohort included residents of Jakarta, Indonesia, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We extracted demographic, clinical, outcome (recovered or died), vaccine coverage data and disease prevalence from Jakarta Health Office surveillance records, and collected subdistrict level sociodemographics data from various official sources. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine individual, community and subdistrict-level healthcare factors and their associations with COVID-19 mortality.                                         Results               Of 705\,503 cases with a definitive outcome by 31 August 2021, 694\,706 (98.5\%) recovered and 10\,797 (1.5\%) died. The median age was 36 years (IQR 24--50), 13.2\% (93 459) were {$<$}18 years and 51.6\% were female. The subdistrict level accounted for 1.5\% of variance in mortality (p{$<$}0.0001). Mortality ranged from 0.9 to 1.8\% by subdistrict. Individual-level factors associated with death were older age, male sex, comorbidities and age {$<$}5 years during the first wave (adjusted OR (aOR)) 1.56, 95\%\,CI 1.04 to 2.35; reference: age 20--29 years). Community-level factors associated with death were poverty (aOR for the poorer quarter 1.35, 95\%\,CI 1.17 to 1.55; reference: wealthiest quarter) and high population density (aOR for the highest density 1.34, 95\%\,CI 1.14 to 2.58; reference: the lowest). Healthcare factor associated with death was low vaccine coverage (aOR for the lowest coverage 1.25, 95\%\,CI 1.13 to 1.38; reference: the highest).                                         Conclusion               In addition to individual risk factors, living in areas with high poverty and density, and low healthcare performance further increase the vulnerability of communities to COVID-19-associated death in urban low-resource settings.},

  abstract = {Background               Policy makers need to be rapidly informed about the potential equity consequences of different COVID-19 strategies, alongside their broader health and economic impacts. While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions.                                         Methods               We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, the Philippines and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of ability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis.                                         Results               In all examined countries, socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles 1--3 were disproportionately more likely to experience income loss (70\% of people) and inability to socially distance (68\% of people) than higher SES quintiles. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 48\% (33\%--60\%) to 66\% (44\%--71\%). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.6\% gross domestic product (0.1\% Pakistan--1.1\% Chile).                                         Conclusions               We illustrate the potential for using publicly available data to rapidly assess the equity implications of social protection and non-pharmaceutical intervention policy. Social protection is likely to mitigate inequitable health and economic impacts of lockdown. Although social protection is usually targeted to the poorest, middle quintiles will likely also need support as they are most likely to suffer income losses and are disproportionately more exposed.},

  abstract = {THE CHALLENGE Measles is one of the most contagious and deadly diseases ever known. In 2016 alone, it infected 7 million people, 1 with 95\% of the cases occurring in low-income countries with weak health systems. Measles spreads much more easily than the flu or Ebola and other headline-grabbing diseases. It remains one of the leading causes of death in children worldwide, killing nearly 250 children per day-despite the fact that a safe and effective vaccine has been available for over 50 years. As we are reminded by recent outbreaks in Yemen, Syria, Bangladesh, and Italy measles anywhere is a threat everywhere. While not as contagious as measles, rubella is an acute viral infection that is especially dangerous during pregnancy. Rubella can be passed from mother to her unborn child during pregnancy, resulting in multiple birth defects, including heart problems, deafness, blindness, and other lifelong complications with immeasurable emotional, social, and financial costs for families. Every year, 100,000 babies are born with CRS. It is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Unlike many other leading causes of childhood disease and death, both measles and rubella are easily preventable with a low-cost, highly effective, combined vaccine. At less than \$2 per dose, vaccinating a child against both measles and rubella is one of the best buys in global health. For every \$1 invested in measles, the return is 58 times that in social and economic benefits. Prevention of measles and rubella is far more cost-effective than managing the diseases, because of the tremendous socioeconomic toll they impose. In Africa, medical costs associated with treating measles can equal one month of family income. The lifetime costs for chronic care per case of CRS can exceed \$11,000 in low-income countries.}

  abstract = {Uncertainty is inherent to our knowledge about the state of the world yet often not communicated alongside scientific facts and numbers. In the ``posttruth'' era where facts are increasingly contested, a common assumption is that communicating uncertainty will reduce public trust. However, a lack of systematic research makes it difficult to evaluate such claims. We conducted five experiments---including one preregistered replication with a national sample and one field experiment on the               BBC News               website (total               n               = 5,780)---to examine whether communicating epistemic uncertainty about facts across different topics (e.g., global warming, immigration), formats (verbal vs. numeric), and magnitudes (high vs. low) influences public trust. Results show that whereas people do perceive greater uncertainty when it is communicated, we observed only a small decrease in trust in numbers and trustworthiness of the source, and mostly for verbal uncertainty communication. These results could help reassure all communicators of facts and science that they can be more open and transparent about the limits of human knowledge.},

Here, we compare COVID-19 disease severity between hospitalized patients in Belgium infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 and those infected with previously circulating strains. Methods The study is conducted within a causal framework to study the severity of SARS-CoV-2 variants by merging surveillance registries in Belgium. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (`exposed') was compared to infection with previously circulating strains (`unexposed') in terms of the manifestation of severe COVID-19, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or in-hospital mortality. The exposed and unexposed group were matched based on the hospital and the mean ICU occupancy rate during the patient's hospital stay. Other variables identified as confounders in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) were adjusted for using regression analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of selection bias, vaccination rollout, and unmeasured confounding. Results We observed no difference between the exposed and unexposed group in severe COVID-19 disease or in-hospital mortality (RR = 1.15, 95\% CI [0.93--1.38] and RR = 0.92, 95\% CI [0.62--1.23], respectively). The estimated standardized risk to be admitted in ICU was significantly higher (RR = 1.36, 95\% CI [1.03--1.68]) when infected with the B.1.1.7 variant. An age-stratified analysis showed that among the younger age group ({$\leq$}65 years), the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was significantly associated with both severe COVID-19 progression and ICU admission. Conclusion This matched observational cohort study did not find an overall increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death associated with B.1.1.7 infection among patients already hospitalized. There was a significant increased risk to be transferred to ICU when infected with the B.1.1.7 variant, especially among the younger age group. However, potential selection biases advocate for more systematic sequencing of samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper presents a non-parametric microsimulation methodology for assessing the impact of labour market changes and government transfers on income inequality and poverty at the household level. The approach assumes that labour markets are segmented and determines (as part of a randomized process) which individuals are expected to move in or out of employment and which move from one employment segment to another based on either known or counterfactual information of aggregate labour market changes. The methodology assumes that the distribution of earnings of those who become employed in a particular segment resembles that of the individuals observed to be employed in that segment. The approach can be effectively combined in top-down fashion with static or dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, which typically provide insufficient information about household income distribution. The paper discusses the virtues and limitations of applying this methodology and further explains to practitioners how to implement it as a stand-alone methodology or in combination with a CGE model. It also shows how the methodology can be generalized to also capture the poverty and inequality effects of changes in non-labour incomes, such as government transfers. One great advantage of this method is that it is not very demanding in terms of modelling labour supply and household behaviour as compared with alternative parametric approaches, while at the same time providing a plausible link between changes in overall labour market conditions and the full household income distribution.}

We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries.},

  abstract = {The response of governments to the COVID-19 outbreak was foremost oriented to two objectives: saving lives and limiting economic losses. However, the effectiveness and success factors of interventions were unknown ex-ante. This study aims to shed light on the drivers of countries' performances during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We measure performances by excess mortality and GDP growth adjusted for additional fiscal stimulus. We conduct an empirical analysis in two stages: first, using hierarchical clustering, we partition countries based on their similarity in health and economic outcomes. Second, we identify the key drivers of outcomes in each country cluster by regression analysis, which include linear, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and logit models. We argue that differences in countries' performances can be traced back both to policy responses to COVID-19 and structural conditions, the latter being immutable over the pandemic. Three relevant structural conditions emerge from the results: trade reliance on services, corruption, and the size of the vulnerable population (elderly, low-income, smoking, or cardiovascular-failing). Policies such as large-scale open public testing and additional fiscal stimulus in non-health could help reduce excess mortality, which might lead to lower economic losses.},

We model the global pattern of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future.                                         Methods               Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions.                                         Results               Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of multiple waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential flare-ups.                                         Conclusions               We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.},

Here, we investigate how awareness-driven behavior modulates epidemic shape. We find that short-term awareness of fatalities leads to emergent plateaus, persistent shoulder-like dynamics, and lag-driven oscillations in an SEIR-like model. However, a joint analysis of fatalities and mobility data suggests that populations relaxed mobility restrictions prior to fatality peaks, in contrast to model predictions. We show that incorporating fatigue and long-term behavior change can explain this phenomenon, shed light on when post-peak dynamics are likely to lead to a resurgence of cases or to sustained declines, and inform public health campaigns to control COVID-19.           ,              The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 1,000,000 reported deaths globally, of which more than 200,000 have been reported in the United States as of October 1, 2020. Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions, the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in most cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena---a qualitative observation reinforced by a symmetry analysis of US state-level fatality data. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, fast increases to the peak are often followed by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations. The asymmetric shape of model-predicted incidence and fatality curves is consistent with observations from many jurisdictions. Yet, in contrast to model predictions, we find that population-level mobility metrics usually increased from low levels before fatalities reached an initial peak. We show that incorporating fatigue and long-term behavior change can reconcile the apparent premature relaxation of mobility reductions and help understand when post-peak dynamics are likely to lead to a resurgence of cases.},

  abstract = {Abstract           COVID-19 has underscored the need for more timely access to vaccines during future pandemics. This has motivated development of broad-spectrum vaccines providing protection against viral families, which could be stockpiled ahead of an outbreak and deployed rapidly following detection. We use mathematical modelling to evaluate the utility of a broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine (BPSV) during a hypothetical SARS-X outbreak, including ring-vaccination, spatial targeting and mass vaccination of high-risk populations. Our results show BPSV ring- or spatially-targeted vaccination strategies are unlikely to contain a SARS-CoV-2-like virus but could contain or slow the spread of a SARS-CoV-1-like virus. Vaccination of high-risk populations with the BPSV ahead of a virus-specific vaccine (VSV) becoming available could substantially reduce mortality. For a 250-day VSV development timeline, BPSV availability reduced infection-related deaths in our model by 54\% on average, though exact impact depended on the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) scenario considered. We further show that BPSV availability enables shorter and less stringent NPIs to be imposed whilst limiting disease burden to that observed in the VSV-only scenario, though results are sensitive to vaccine properties (e.g. efficacy), health system capabilities (e.g. vaccination rollout speed) and the assumed timeline to VSV availability. Our modelling suggests that availability of a BPSV for those aged 60+ years could have averted 40-65\% of COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic's first year, with exact impact depending on the size of the maintained stockpile. Our work highlights significant potential impact of a BPSV, but that achieving this depends on investment into health systems enabling rapid and equitable access during future SARS-X pandemics.},

Materials \& methods: A systematic review of EE guidelines for healthcare, published up to July 2022, was conducted. Results: A total of 52 EE guidelines were reviewed. The majority of these guidelines recommend equal discounting (80.8\%) rather than differential discounting (9.6\%). The rationale for equal discounting includes recommendations by the government, consistency with other countries, and economic development. However, the rationale for differential discounting is based on the interest in short-term government bonds and anticipated budget changes. Discussion: This review demonstrates variation in both discounting approaches and rates across EE guidelines and underscores the need for a global consensus on discounting approaches.},

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only set of pandemic countermeasures that are readily available at all times and in all countries. The potential impacts of NPIs on an influenza epidemic or pandemic are to delay the introduction of the pandemic virus into a population; delay the height and peak of the epidemic if the epidemic has started; reduce transmission by personal protective or environmental measures; and reduce the total number of infections and hence the total number of severe cases.},

Indeed, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization figures show that two-thirds of an academic year was lost on average worldwide due to COVID-19 school closures. Such pre-emptive implementation was predicated on the premise that school children are a core group for COVID-19 transmission. Using surveillance data from the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Anqing together, we inferred that compared with the elderly aged 60 and over, children aged 18 and under and adults aged 19-59 were 75\% and 32\% less susceptible to infection, respectively. Using transmission models parametrized with synthetic contact matrices for 177 jurisdictions around the world, we showed that the lower susceptibility of school children substantially limited the effectiveness of school closure in reducing COVID-19 transmissibility. Our results, together with recent findings that clinical severity of COVID-19 in children is lower, suggest that school closure may not be ideal as a sustained, primary intervention for controlling COVID-19.

Recent studies suggest that weather variables, such as absolute humidity, are the key drivers of annual influenza outbreaks. The rapid, punctuated, antigenic evolution of the influenza virus is another major factor. We present a newframework for modelling seasonal influenza based on a discrete-time, age-of-infection, epidemicmodel, which allows the calculation of themodel's likelihood function in closed form. This framework may be used to perform model inference and parameter estimation rigorously. Themodelling approach allows us to fit 11 years of Israeli influenza data, with the best models fitting the data with unusually high correlations in which r {$>$} 0.9.We show that using actual weather to modulate influenza transmission rate gives better results than using the inter-annual means of the weather variables, providing strong support for the role of weather in shaping the dynamics of influenza. This conclusion remains valid even when incorporating amore realistic depiction of the decay of immunity at the population level, which allows for discrete changes in immunity from year to year. {\copyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {Mathematical models have come to play a key role in global pandemic preparedness and outbreak response: helping to plan for disease burden, hospital capacity, and inform nonpharmaceutical interventions. Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models---and, by consequence, modelers---guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as ``equal opportunity infectors'' despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Abstract             East Asia is as a principal hotspot for emerging zoonotic infections. Understanding the likely pathways for their emergence and spread requires knowledge on human-human and human-animal contacts, but such studies are rare. We used self-completed and interviewer-completed contact diaries to quantify patterns of these contacts for 965 individuals in 2017/2018 in a high-income densely-populated area of China, Shanghai City. Interviewer-completed diaries recorded more social contacts (19.3 vs. 18.0) and longer social contact duration (35.0 vs. 29.1\,hours) than self-reporting. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups especially among young participants (aged 7--20) and middle aged participants (25--55 years). 17.7\% of participants reported touching animals (15.3\% (pets), 0.0\% (poultry) and 0.1\% (livestock)). Human-human contact was very frequent but contact with animals (especially poultry) was rare although associated with frequent human-human contact. Hence, this densely populated area is more likely to act as an accelerator for human-human spread but less likely to be at the source of a zoonosis outbreak. We also propose that telephone interview at the end of reporting day is a potential improvement of the design of future contact surveys.},
