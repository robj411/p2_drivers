\title{DAEDALUS for CEPI's 100-day mission: code and model description}
\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This document describes the DAEDALUS model that is used in the CEPI application. The DAEDALUS model simulates a single epidemic in a single country. Details of how the DAEDALUS model is used as a part of the methodology of the CEPI application is presented in a separate report, which also details the scenarios which are expressed as vaccination rates and are inputs to the DAEDALUS model.

\section{Simulation rules}\label{simulation-rules}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The country is instantiated with two random variables: the response time, and the pathogen importation time
\item
  The response time is the day at which the country reports having seen X hospital cases, where X is a random number between 1 and 20
\item
  The importation time is a random number between 0 and 20 days. An importation time of 0 days would be equivalent to the spillover event.
\item
  The epidemic simulation starts at the response or the importation time (the one that is smaller)
\item
  At the importation time, five people are moved from compartment S to compartment E
\item
  At the response time, testing begins and working from home begins
\item
  If closure policies (RC1, RC2, or RC3) are being implemented, the rules in Tables \ref{tab:rulesreactive} or \ref{tab:ruleselimination} are followed
\item
  Vaccination is a model input whose details depend on the scenario. The model allows for two vaccines to be administered flexibly, in that the first is not a prerequisite for the second. In the CEPI application, the first vaccine is a broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine (BPSV) and the second is a strain-specific vaccine (SSV).
\item
  Closures, working from home and testing end when vaccine rollout completes (or if other stopping criteria are met, see Tables \ref{tab:rulesreactive} and \ref{tab:ruleselimination})
\item
  When vaccine rollout is complete, the doubling time is more than 30 days and there are fewer than 1,000 people in hospital, the simulation ends.
\end{itemize}

\section{Socio-economic costs}\label{socio-economic-costs}

We assign monetary values to years of life lost (YLL) and to years of education in order to add health and education costs of sector-closure policies to the costs of economic closures. We define the total socio-economic loss (TSL) of an epidemic as the sum of the three types of loss:

\begin{equation}
\text{TSL} = K_1\text{VLY} + K_2 + K_3\text{VSY},
\label{eq:swf}
\end{equation}

where \(K_1\) is the number of life years lost and VLY the value of a life year; \(K_2\) is the sum of lost GDP over the period due to reduced economic activity of sectors; and \(K_3\) is the number of school years lost and VSY the value of one school year.

\subsection{Lost economic activity}\label{lost-economic-activity}

We measure the cost of economic closures in terms of lost gross value added (GVA): the GDP generated by an economic configuration is the maximum GVA (denoted \(y_j\) for each sector \(j\)) multiplied by the respective sector openings, summed over the period (\(\tau\) days). The maximum possible GDP (which is with no closures) is

\[Y_0=\frac{\tau}{365}\sum_{j=1}^{m_S}y_j\]

for \(m_S\) sectors, and we use pre-pandemic GVA to define the maximum possible values.

All economic sectors contribute GVA according to the level they are open for production, except for the education sector which contributes its maximum possible GVA, \(y_{\text{ed}}\). \(x_{j}(t)\) is the proportion of the workforce contributing to economic production in sector \(j\) out of the total workforce \(N_j\) on day \(t\). The workforce can be additionally depleted due to self isolation, sickness, hospitalisation and death, leaving a smaller fraction (\(`\hat{x}_{j}(t)`\)) to contribute to production.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}hat\{x\}\_\{j\}(t)=x\_\{j\}(t)\textbackslash{}left(1 {-} \textbackslash{}left(p\_j\^{}\{23\}(t)  + (1{-}q\_j)p\_j\^{}\{22\}(t)\textbackslash{}right)/N\_j\textbackslash{}right)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where \(q_j\) is the fraction of the sector working from home. \(p_j^{23}(t)\) represents worker sickness and death:

\[p_j^{23}(t)=\sum_{v=0}^{m_V}\left(\left(1-p^H_{j,v}\right)p^1p^{19}I_{j,v}^{s}+p^H_{j,v}p^1I_{j,v}^{s}+H_{j,v}+D_{j,v}\right),\]

with \(m_V=2\) vaccines and \(p_j^{22}(t)\) represents lost output from asymptomatic self-isolating workers:

\[p_j^{22}(t)=p^2(t)p^{18}I_{j}^{a}.\]

\(p^{18}\) is the number of days spent in self isolation per day of infectiousness (e.g.~suppose the average infectious period is four days and mandatory self-isolation time is ten days, then \(p^{19}=2.5\) and \(p^{18}=p^{19}T^{I^s}/T^{I^a:R}\), where \(T^{I^s}\) and \(T^{I^a:R}\) are expected infectious periods for symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively). \(p^1\) is compliance with the requirement to self isolate and \(p^2(t)\) is the fraction of cases identified. Other notations are vaccine status \(v\), infectious and asymptomatic \(I_{j,v}^{a}\), infectious and symptomatic \(I_{j,v}^{s}\), hospitalised \(H\), deceased \(D\), and probability to be hospitalised \(p^H\).

Then the total GDP is

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Y =  \textbackslash{}frac\{1 \}\{365\} \textbackslash{}sum\_\{j\textbackslash{}neq\textbackslash{}text\{ed\}\}\^{}\{m\_S\}y\_j\textbackslash{}int\_\{t=0\}\^{}\{\textbackslash{}tau\}\textbackslash{}hat\{x\}\_\{j\}(t)dt + \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}tau \}\{365\}\{y\_\textbackslash{}text\{ed\}\},}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and the GDP loss compared to the maximum is

\[K_2=Y_0-Y.\]

\subsection{Lost lives}\label{lost-lives}

To value lives lost, we make use of the expected remaining life years per age group estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Network \citep{GlobalBurdenofDiseaseCollaborativeNetwork2021}. These are used to estimate the expected number of years of life lost per death, and to estimate the value of a life year. We map the remaining life expectancy \(\tilde{l}_a\) for the GBD age groups \(a\) to \(l_g\) for the (different) age groups \(g\) of our model as a population-weighted average, taking into account the size of each age group, \(`\tilde{N}_a`\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{l\_g\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{(life)\}\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}N\_a\textbackslash{}tilde\{l\}\_a\}\{\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}\textbackslash{}tilde\{N\}\_a\}; }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To estimate the expected number of life years lost per SARS-X death, we take into account the probability to die given infection, \(P(D|I,a)\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{l\_g\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{(death)\}\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}N\_a\textbackslash{}tilde\{l\}\_aP(D|I,a)\}\{\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}N\_aP(D|I,a)\}; }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The total number of years lost given \(D_g\) deaths due to COVID-19 for each age group is

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{K\_1=\textbackslash{}sum\_gD\_gl\_g\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{(death)\}\}.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The value of a statistical life (VSL) reflects individuals' willingness to trade wealth for reductions in risk of mortality. We rely on the intrinsic rather than instrumental interpretation of the valuation of life \citep{Cutler2020}, and we use an existing estimate of the VSL to estimate the value of a life year (VLY). We interpret the VSL as a population-weighted average \citep{Ananthapavan2021, Robinson2021}, where each age group has a VSL defined by the number of expected life years remaining, and where each year has the same value:

\begin{equation}
\text{VSL}=\frac{\sum_gN_gl_g^{\text{(life)}}}{\sum_gN_g}\text{VLY}.
\end{equation}

Following \citet{TheGlobalFund2022}, ``In this way, we made a choice to value deaths proportionally to the remaining life expectancy associated with the counterfactual of that death (how long they would live if they had not died)''.

We estimate a country's VSL using the VSL of the USA, adjusting for the difference in income. We also adjust for the elasticity of willingness to pay for reductions in mortality risk relative to income. The income elasticity is likely larger in lower-income countries than in higher-income countries because the opportunity cost of spending on basic necessities becomes large if incomes are at or below subsistence levels \citep{Hammitt2020}.

We estimate VSL as a function of GDP, relative to values for the USA:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}text\{VSL\}=\textbackslash{}text\{VSL\}\_\{\textbackslash{}text\{USA\}\}\textbackslash{}left(r\_p\textbackslash{}frac\{Y\_0\}\{\textbackslash{}text\{GDP\}\_\{\textbackslash{}text\{USA\}\}\}\textbackslash{}right)\^{}\{r\_e\}.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, \(`\text{VSL}_{\text{USA}}`\) is a 2019 estimate of VSL for the USA (10.9 million \$) and \(`\text{GDP}_{\text{USA}}`\) is its GDP. We choose randomly between two alternative methods, OECD/IHME/World Bank and Viscusi \& Masterman, to map from USA's VSL to the VSL of our country, as discussed in \citet{Robinson2021}. We implement the methods using approximations to the presentations therein, which we summarise in see Table \ref{tab:ruleselimination}.

Parameter \(r_p\) is a conversion rate from GDP based on market exchange rates (MER) to GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP). We specify that the conversion is 1, i.e.~equivalence and effective valuation at MER, for the Viscusi \& Masterman method, and an income-level--specific random conversion variable sampled from World Bank Data for the OECD/IHME/World Bank method.

Parameter \(r_e\) is the income elasticity. For an HIC we set it to 0.8, and otherwise we draw it from a uniform distribution between 0.9 and 1.2 with the OECD/IHME/World Bank method. For the Viscusi \& Masterman method, we set it to 1 if the GDP per capita (GDPpc) is less than \$8,809, and sample from a uniform distribution between 0.85 and 1 otherwise. We use this approach in order to represent our uncertainty about the appropriate method to calculate the VSL for one country using the VSL from another.

We note that in the methods presented in Table \ref{tab:vslrules} there is a relationship between exchange rate and elasticity, in that the flatter elasticities of Viscusi/Masterman are matched with GDP based on MER, whereas the more graduated elasticities of the OECD/IHME/World Bank method are matched with GDP based on PPP. This might be because these choices enact inverse transformations of low VSL values for GDP (Figure \ref{fig:pppelasticity}).

\subsection{Lost education}\label{lost-education}

The loss due to school closure is

\[K_3 =  \frac{1 }{365} \int_{t=0}^{\tau}\left(p^{14}(t)N_{j_{\text{school}}} + (1-p^{14}(t))p^{25}(t)  +(1-2p^{14}(t))p^{24}(t)\right)dt,\]

where \(p^{14}(t)\) is the effective amount of education lost per student at time \(t\) due to school closure:
\[p^{14}(t) = (1-p^{16})(1-x_{\text{ed}}(t)),\]
\(N_{j_{\text{school}}}\) is the total number of students, \(p^{16}\) is relative effectiveness of remote education and \(x_{\text{ed}}(t)\) is the openness of schools, \(p^{25}(t)\) represents education lost due to student sickness with COVID-19:

\[p^{25}(t)=\sum_{v=0}^{m_V}\left((1-p^H_{j_{\text{school}},v})p^1p^{19}I_{j_{\text{school}},v}^{s}+p^H_{j_{\text{school}},v}p^1I_{j_{\text{school}},v}^{s}+H_{j_{\text{school}},v}\right),\]

\(p^{18}\) is the number of days spent in self isolation per day of infectiousness (e.g.~suppose the average infectious period is four days and mandatory self-isolation time is ten days, then \(p^{19}=2.5\) and \(p^{18}=p^{19}T^{I^s}/T^{I^a:R}\), where \(T^{I^s}\) and \(T^{I^a:R}\) are expected infectious periods for symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively), and \(p^{24}(t)\) represents education lost due to asymptomatic self isolation (which comes at a cost only when schools are open):

\[p^{24}(t)=p^2(t)p^{18}I_{j_{\text{school}}}^{a}.\]

For the value of a year of education, we use the method of \citep{Psacharopoulos2021a}.

\[\text{VSY} =  p^{12}\cdot p^{13}\cdot p^{15}.\]

\(p^{12}\) is the present value of lost earnings:

\[p^{12} = \frac{1}{N_{j_{\text{school}}}}\sum_{a\in j_{\text{school}}}\tilde{N}_a\left( \frac{1-(1+r)^{-(m_Y+20-a)}}{r} -  \frac{1-(1+r)^{-(20-a)}}{r}\right)\]

for discount rate \(r=0.03\), number \(\tilde{N}_a\) students currently age \(a\), and expected number of years of work \(m_Y=45\). \(p^{13}\) is mean annual earnings, and \(p^{15}=0.08\) is the rate of return for one year of education.

The value \(p^{16}\) represents the effectiveness of remote teaching, which we sample as a standard uniform random variable. We note that no strong predictors of effectiveness of remote teaching have been identified \citep{Patrinos2023}. We assume that losses are linear in duration of school closure, although there is not consensus even on this \citep{Betthauser2023}. Important factors to include in future work might be those relating to parental circumstances including education level, engagement and socio-economic status \citep{Moscoviz2022}. These factors might be more pertinent to intra- rather than international modelling.

\section{Epi model}\label{epi-model}

The epidemiological component of the DAEDALUS model is a deterministic compartmental model that consists of seven disease states (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious, hospitalised, recovered, and deceased), in triplicate to represent vaccination states unvaccinated, vaccinated with the BPSV, and vaccinated with the SSV. The population is stratified by age (into four age groups: pre-school children, school-age children, working-age adults, and retirement-age adults). The working-age adults are further stratified into 46 groups: 45 economic sectors, plus one non-working group.

\subsection{Disease state transitions}\label{disease-state-transitions}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/statetransitions-1} \caption{Disease state transitions. $S$: susceptible. $E$: exposed. $I^{a}$: asymptomatic infectious. $I^{s}$: symptomatic infectious. $H$: hospitalised. $R$: recovered. $D$: died. $j$: stratum. $v$: vaccination status.}\label{fig:statetransitions}
\end{figure}

Possible transitions between disease states are shown in Figure \ref{fig:statetransitions}. Transition rates are functions of time \(t\), vaccination status \(v\), and group identity \(j\) (where the groups are the 45 sectors and the four age groups).

The rate of infection of susceptible individuals, \(`k^{1}_{j,v}(t)`\), is defined as

\begin{equation}
k_{j,v}^{1}(t) = \eta_{v}^{E}\rho(t)\beta\sum_{h=1}^{m_J}M_{j,h}(x) I_h(t)
\label{eq:infection}
\end{equation}

with \(m_J=49\) strata and

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ I\_h(t)=\textbackslash{}sum\_\{v=0\}\^{}\{m\_V\}\textbackslash{}left(\textbackslash{}epsilon (1{-}p\^{}3(t))I\_\{h,v\}\^{}\{a\}(t)+(1{-}p\^{}4(t))I\_\{h,v\}\^{}\{s\}(t)\textbackslash{}right). }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here, \(`\eta^{E}_{v}`\) is the relative probability to be infected given vaccine status \(v\); \(\rho(t)\) is the time-dependent modifier of the rate of infection, \(\beta\), which captures the impact of uncosted transmission reductions; \(M(x)\) is the contact matrix between groups and depends on the economic configuration \(x\); \(\epsilon\) is the reduction in infectiousness from asymptomatic relative to symptomatic individuals; \(p^3\) and \(p^4\) are the proportions of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectiousness averted, respectively, due to self isolating; and \(I_{h,\cdot}^{\cdot}\) is the number of infectious asymptomatic (\(I_{h,\cdot}^{a}\)) and symptomatic (\(I_{h,\cdot}^{s}\)) people who are unvaccinated (\(I_{h,v=0}^{\cdot}\)), vaccinated with the BPSV (\(I_{h,v=1}^{\cdot}\)), or vaccinated with the specific vaccine (\(I_{h,v=2}^{\cdot}\)) in stratum \(h\).

\NormalTok{ k\^{}2 = \textbackslash{}big(1{-}p\^{}\{I\^{}S\}\textbackslash{}big)/T\^{}\{E:I\} }

is the rate to asymptomatic infectiousness, where \(p^{I^S}\) is the probability to become symptomatic given infection, and \(T^{E:I}\) is the expected duration of the latent period before the onset of infectiousness;

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ k\^{}3 = 1/T\^{}\{I\^{}a:R\}  }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the rate of recovery from asymptomatic infection;

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ k\^{}4 = p\^{}\{I\^{}S\}/ T\^{}\{E:I\}; }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the rate of symptom onset;

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{k\^{}\{5\}\_\{j,v\} =  \textbackslash{}big(1{-}p\^{}H\_\{j,v\}\textbackslash{}big) / T\_\{j,v\}\^{}\{I\^{}s\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the rate of recovery from symptomatic infection, where \(p^H_{j,v}\) is the probability to be hospitalised given symptomatic infection, and \(T_{j,v}^{I^s} = p^H_{j,v}T^{I^s:H} + (1-p^H_{j,v})T^{I^s:R}\) is the expected time to be in compartment \(I^s\): \(T^{I^s:H}\) is the expected duration before hospitalisation and \(T^{I^s:R}\) is the expected duration before recovery.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{p\^{}H\_\{j,v\}=\textbackslash{}eta\^{}\{H\}\_\{v\}\textbackslash{}tilde\{p\}\^{}\{H\}\_\{j\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the baseline probability to be hospitalised (\(`\tilde{p}^{H}_{j}`\)) adjusted by the vaccine effect protecting against hospitalisation (\(`\eta^{H}_{v}`\)). Then

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{k\^{}\{6\}\_\{j,v\} = p\^{}H\_\{j,v\}/T\_\{j,v\}\^{}\{I\^{}s\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the rate of hospitalisation following symptomatic infection.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{k\^{}\{7\}\_\{j\}(t) = (1{-}p\^{}\{D\}\_\{j\}(t)) / T\_j\^{}\{H\}(t)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the rate of recovery of hospitalised patients, where \(`p^{D}_{j}(t)=\tilde{p}^{D}_{j}f_H(t)`\) is the baseline probability to die given hospitalisation, adjusted by a factor encoding the increase in fatality rate as hospital occupancy increases:

\begin{verbatim}
<!-- (1 + 0.87*max(0, occ - Hmax) / occ)*pd; -->
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\[T_j^{H}(t) = p_j^{D}(t)T^{H:D} + (1-p_{j}^{D}(t))T^{H:R}\]

is the expected time to be in compartment \(H\): \(T^{H:D}\) is the expected duration before death and \(T^{H:R}\) is the expected duration before recovery. Finally,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{k\^{}\{8\}\_\{j\}(t) = p\^{}\{D\}\_\{j\}(t)/T\_j\^{}\{H\}(t)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

is the rate of death following hospitalisation.

\subsection{Vaccination state transitions}\label{vaccination-state-transitions}

In our model, \(v=0\) refers to unvaccinated people, \(v=1\) to people who have received a full schedule of BPSV, and \(v=2\) to people who have received a full schedule of the specific vaccine. How we model transitions between vaccination states is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vaccinetransitions}.

\(`k^{10,c_1}_{j,v=0}(t)`\) represents the rates of BPSV vaccination of unvaccinated susceptible and recovered people, and \(`k^{10,c_2}_{j,v=1}(t)`\) represents the rates of vaccinating BPSV-vaccinated susceptible and recovered people. \(`k^{10,c_2}_{j,v=0}(t)`\) represents the rates of vaccinating people directly with the specific vaccine. Put more succinctly, \(`k^{10,c_u}_{j,v}(t)`\) is the rate to go from vaccine state \(v\) to \(u\). \(k^9=1/T^c\) is the rate of seroconversion to vaccine-induced immunity, and \(`k^{12}_{j}(t)=k^{1}_{j,v=0}(t)`\) and \(`k^{19}_{j}(t)=k^{1}_{j,v=1}(t)`\) are the rates of infection of just-vaccinated people, which returns them to the epidemiological pathway of the lower vaccination level.

\begin{figure}

\subsection{Contact rates}\label{contact-rates}

The configuration \(x\) and the proportion of workers working from home \(q\) determine the scaling of exposure to infection between different groups for different reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Worker absence due to sector closure
\item
  Worker absence due to working from home
\item
  Student absence due to school closure
\item
  Customer absence due to sector closure: impact on workers
\item
  Customer absence due to sector closure: impact on customers
\end{itemize}

We approach this differently from \citep{Haw2020}. Instead of contact matrices from \citep{Prem2021}, we use those from \citep{Walker2020}. Instead of work contacts from \citep{Beraud2015}, we use those from \citep{Jarvis2023}. \citep{Haw2020} modelled closures using a combination of moving workers between sector compartments and a non-working compartment, and scaling of contacts. Here, we only use contacts to model closures, and do not move workers out of their compartments. An advantage of this is that workers within sectors retain their infection histories.

We construct contact matrix \(M(x)\) as the sum of three matrices: \(M^{\text{com}}(x)\) (community contacts), \(M^{\text{CW}}(x)\) (community-to-worker contacts), and \(M^{\text{WC}}(x)\) (worker-to-community contacts). We construct peacetime matrices (\(x=\textbf{1}\)) beginning with a ``target matrix'', which the three matrices should add up to, which is taken from \citep{Walker2020}. By sampling relevant values, we decompose the whole matrix into its component parts. To incorporate closures, each matrix is transformed independently, before they are all added together again.

Matrix \(M(\textbf{1})\) is estimated using as a basis a contact matrix from \citep{Walker2020}. These are 16-by-16 matrices, \(\tilde{M}\), for five-year age bands \(a\) up to age group 75+. We map the matrix to a four-by-four matrix \(\hat{M}\) corresponding to the four age groups \(g\) used in the DAEDALUS model, using population sizes \(\tilde{N}_a\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}hat\{M\}\_\{gg\textquotesingle{}\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}\textbackslash{}tilde\{N\}\_\{a\}\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}in g\textquotesingle{}\}\textbackslash{}tilde\{M\}\_\{a,a\textquotesingle{}\}\}\{\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}\textbackslash{}tilde\{N\}\_\{a\}\},}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and \(\hat{N}_g\) to represent the population sizes of the DAEDALUS age groups,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}hat\{N\}\_g=\textbackslash{}sum\_\{a\textbackslash{}in g\}\textbackslash{}tilde\{N\}\_a.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We get to the matrix \(M(\textbf{1})\) by broadcasting the four-by-four matrix to the 49-by-49 one. Contacts from all groups \(j\) to working groups \(h\) depend on the age group of the group (\(`g(j)`\)), and the fraction of the age-population represented in group \(h\), where \(N_{h}\) is the number of people in group \(h\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{M\_\{j,h\}(\textbackslash{}textbf\{1\}) = \textbackslash{}hat\{M\}\_\{g(j),g(h)\}\textbackslash{}frac\{N\_\{h\}\}\{\textbackslash{}hat\{N\}\_\{g(h)\}\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

for \(j\) and \(h\) including all groups (working and non-working). Each group \(j\) contains people that belong to only one age group \(g\). We refer to the age group of the people in group \(j\) as \(g(j)\). Then \(\hat{N}_{g(h)}\) is the number of people in the age group of group \(h\), so \(`\hat{N}_{g(h)}=N_{h}`\) for age groups 0 to 4, 5 to 19 and 65+, and \(`\hat{N}_{g(h)}=\sum_{h\in\{1,...,m_S,m_S+3\}}N_{h}`\) for age group 20 to 64.

In setting up a country, we sample values for \(\tilde{M}\) (from which we get \(`M(\textbf{1})`\)). At the same time, we sample the proportion of contacts that come from workplaces (Figure \ref{fig:workfrac}), and workplace-related contacts. From these, we get \(M^{\text{CW}}(\textbf{1})\), constructing the matrices and normalising.

Community-to-worker contacts (matrix \(M^{\text{CW}}\)) describe contacts experienced by workers from the community by sector (Figure \ref{fig:allsector}, distributed by age, Figure \ref{fig:uksecdistage}). Note that \(`M^{\text{CW}}_{j,h}(\textbf{1})=0`\) for \(j>m_S\). Matrix \(M^{\text{WC}}(\textbf{1})\) is the complement of matrix \(M^{\text{CW}}(\textbf{1})\), computed by multiplying through by population, transposing, and dividing again by population.

With \(M(\textbf{1})\), \(M^{\text{CW}}(\textbf{1})\) and \(M^{\text{WC}}(\textbf{1})\), we learn \(M^{\text{com}}(\textbf{1})\).

\(M^{\text{com}}(\textbf{1})\) is decomposed into its constituent parts, representing intra- and inter-household interactions (home), school interactions (sch) and hospitality interactions (CC):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{com\}\}(\textbackslash{}textbf\{1\})=M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{home\}\} + M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{sch\}\}(\textbackslash{}textbf\{1\}) + M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{CC\}\}(\textbackslash{}textbf\{1\}) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Values for \(M^{\text{sch}}(\textbf{1})\) come from sampled values representing the fractions of contacts that come from school. School contacts are estimated separately in two age groups (pre-school age: 0-\/--4 (Figure \ref{fig:school1frac}); school age: 5-\/--19 (Figure \ref{fig:school2frac})): \(M^{\text{sch}}(\textbf{1})\) has entries of zero for groups not in school, and values for 0 to 4 year olds and 5 to 19 year olds.

Finally, \(M^{\text{CC}}(\textbf{1})\) is sampled as a fraction of \(M^{\text{com}}(\textbf{1})- M^{\text{sch}}(\textbf{1})\) (Figure \ref{fig:hospfrac}, distributed by age, Figure \ref{fig:conagefrac}), which leaves \(M^{\text{home}}\). Community contacts in consumption settings includes contacts made on public transport, as these contacts are small in number and are most correlated with consumption (and not work or school) \citep{Jarvis2023}. (This might be because contacts are counted by how many people you talk to.)

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Community contacts}\label{community-contacts}

We construct \(M^{\text{com}}(x)\) from its constituent parts, representing intra- and inter-household interactions (home), school interactions (sch) and hospitality interactions (CC):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{com\}\}(x)=M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{home\}\} + M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{sch\}\}(x) + M\^{}\{\textbackslash{}text\{CC\}\}(x).}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

School contacts under \(x\) are the peacetime values scaled by the extent of closure. \(x_{\text{ed}}\) is the extent to which schools are open, so that the number of contacts per person scales superlinearly with school closure.

\begin{equation}
M_{j,j}^{\text{sch}}(x)=x_{\text{ed}}^2M_{j,j}^{\text{sch}}(\textbf{1}).
\label{eq:school}
\end{equation}

Matrix \(M^{\text{CC}}(x)\) gives the contacts made in the hospitality sector:

\begin{equation}
M^{\text{CC}}(x) = (p^{27})^2M^{\text{CC}}(\textbf{1})
\label{eq:hosp}
\end{equation}

The value \(p^{27}\) is the workforce-weighted average extent to which the hospitality sectors are open, so that the number of contacts per person scales superlinearly according to closure:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{p\^{}\{27\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}sum\_jx\_\{j\}N\_j\}\{\textbackslash{}sum\_jN\_j\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where we sum over only the hospitality sectors.

\subsubsection{Community-to-worker contacts}\label{community-to-worker-contacts}

\begin{equation}
M_{j,h}^{\text{CW}}(x) = (x_{j}(1-q_j))^2M_{j,h}^{\text{CW}}(\textbf{1}),
\label{eq:ctow}
\end{equation}

for \(h\in\{1,...,m_J\}\).

Here, there is superlinear scaling of \(M^{\text{CW}}_{j,h}(\textbf{1})\) with respect to working from home and with respect to sector closure, as both workers and members of the community are absent from the workplace as the sector moves online and becomes more closed.

\subsection{Uncosted transmission reductions}\label{uncosted-transmission-reductions}

We parametrise the effects of `uncosted transmission reductions' (UTR) in the model using Google's mobility data (Figure \ref{fig:smoothmobility}). These changes in mobility were consequences of both government mandates and individual's choices. As we cannot separate the two, we consider a range of possibilities, based on the range of mobility changes observed for a given level of stringency (Figure \ref{fig:mobilitydrop}). In our model, the mandated economic configuration leads to a change in contacts. We associate the reduction in contacts, which translates as a relative reduction in transmission, with the reduction in mobility.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-gfm/smoothmobility} \caption{Mobility trajectories in 2020 for all countries, with points showing the point at which the largest drop was observed. Trajectories are averaged over "Retail and recreation", "Transit stations" and "Workplaces" and smoothed with a spline of 80 knots.}\label{fig:smoothmobility}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-gfm/mobilitydrop} \caption{The largest drop in mobility plotted against the stringency on that date.}\label{fig:mobilitydrop}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We want to write mobility as a function of mandate and some epi outcome, e.g.~deaths: \(\rho(t) = (1-p^8)f(d(t),e(t)) + p^8\) where \(\rho(t)\) is mobility, \(d\) is deaths per million, \(e\) is government mandate, and \(`0 < p^8 < 1`\) is the baseline.
\item
  We want mobility to drop monotonically with both the mandate and the epi outcome: \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial d}<0\), \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial e}<0\).
\item
  We want a maximum mobility of 1 when both the mandate and the epi outcome are 0: \(f(0,0)=1\).
\item
  We want mobility to approach \(p^8\) when the mandate and the epi outcome become large: \(\lim_{d\to 10^6, e\to 1}f(d,e)= 0\).
\item
  We want to allow for the possibility of redundancy between the two variables: \(f(0,0)/f(0,e) > f(d,0)/f(d,e)\) and \(f(0,0)/f(d,0) > f(0,e)/f(d,e)\) for \(d,e>0\).
\end{itemize}

A simple model to achieve these criteria is: \[f(d,e) = \frac{1}{1+p^9d+p^{10}e}\]
with \(p^9, p^{10}>0\).

The implications of this modelling choice are that two extremes are possible in terms of behaviour under (unseen) circumstances of a severe moment in an outbreak: 1, it is possible that social distancing comes ``free'' (i.e.~that you get the same reduction in transmission with and without closures and, without closures, there is no economic cost); and 2, there is no voluntary social distancing, and behaviour is independent of epidemiological circumstances. This is an assumption commonly made to create the counterfactual in evaluating impacts of vaccine programmes. This is a very large source of uncertainty, and we expect it to be identified as such in value-of-information analyses.

Finally, we assume that the effect wanes over time, with the minimum (baseline) tending to 1 with a rate of 0 to 0.1\% per day.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-gfm/mobilitycurves} \caption{Sampled curves for four levels of mitigation. Data shown as points.}\label{fig:mobilitycurves}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Testing and self isolating}\label{testing-and-self-isolating}

We assume that infectious people who know their status have a compliance \(p^1\sim\text(Beta)(5,5)\) with the instruction to self isolate, starting one day into their infectious period. We assume constant infectiousness over time and that a fraction \(p^{26}\) of the symptomatic infectiousness is presymptomatic. Then the amount of infectiousness averted of symptomatic people is \(p^4=p^1(1-p^{26})\), who isolate due to the onset of symptoms. The fraction of asymptomatic cases identified by testing is \(p^2(t)\). We assume asymptomatic cases have the same probability to self isolate and that test results are returned after \(p^{17}\) days of infectiousness. Then the infectiousness that testing averts is \(p^3(t)=p^1p^2(t)\min(0,(T^{I^a:R}-p^{17})/T^{I^a:R})\).

\section{Econ model}\label{econ-model}

The economic model is measuring GDP by summing GVA over sectors and over time taking into account the extent to which sectors are open, as described in Section \ref{lost-economic-activity}.

The economy is stratified by sector following the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Rev.~4 as used by the OECD \citep{un}. Economic output is measured as the sum of gross value added (GVA) of all sectors over the epidemic period, expressed as a percentage of pre-epidemic GVA summed over the same period.

Openness comes primarily from the economic configuration which is a policy choice, mandated in response to the epidemic (see Section \ref{closure-policies}). There are potentially additional losses due to worker sickness and death (see Section \ref{lost-economic-activity}) and due to lost tourism, which is an exogenous random variable (see Section \ref{impact-of-tourism}). We do not model changes to supply or demand, reductions in consumption and labour supply due to infection avoidance of individuals, interruptions in supply chains, or changes in imports and exports.

Lost education is also quantified monetarily and constitutes an economic cost. Unlike the other losses, they are not contemporaneous with the epidemic, but losses that unfold into the future. The assumptions and equations are described in Section \ref{lost-education}.

\subsection{Impact of tourism}\label{impact-of-tourism}

\subsubsection{Food and accommodation services sector}\label{food-and-accommodation-services-sector}

As there is no ``tourism'' sector in the 45-sector classification we are using, to model the impact of changes to tourism, we identify the ``Food and accommodation services'' sector with tourism. This is imperfect. The correlation of their \% contributions to GDP is 0.64 and the order of magnitude is similar (1 to 7\% vs 2 to 10\% of GDP). The other two sectors considered (Air transport and Arts, entertainment and recreation) have little correlation with tourism in terms of \% of GDP. (See Figure \ref{fig:pairs}.)

\begin{figure}

\subsubsection{Sector shrinkage as a result of the pandemic}\label{sector-shrinkage-as-a-result-of-the-pandemic}

For many countries, tourism was reduced in the COVID-19 pandemic not because of domestic mandates but because of reduced international travel. Therefore, the fraction of tourism that comes from abroad is a factor that can determine the impact of a pandemic on a country's GDP potentially independently of what happens within the country. (A useful model extension would be to include some dependence on country factors, e.g.~case numbers.)

We model mitigation via business closures, which are mandated by sector. We represent openness with values \(x\) which range from 0 to 1, 1 representing maximum openness. To capture the impact of reduced international travel, we set the maximum openness of the food and accommodation services sector to be limited by international tourism as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x = \textbackslash{}min\textbackslash{}\{\textbackslash{}hat\{x\}, 1+ b(c{-}1)\textbackslash{}\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where \(`\hat{x}`\) is the openness of the sector according to the schedule (i.e.~the sector-closure policy), \(b\) is the proportion of tourism that is international, and \(c\) is the fraction international tourism reduces to as a consequence of the pandemic. I.e. the tourism remaining is the domestic (\(1-b\)) plus that that comes in from abroad (\(bc\)).

Therefore, the contribution of the GVA of the food and accommodation services sector is limited either by the pandemic, or by the sector-closure policy - whichever is lower.

\subsubsection{Loss of international tourists}\label{loss-of-international-tourists}

We model the distribution of \(c\) using data from 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:tourismhist}, bottom-right plot). We fit to it a log-normal distribution, and find mean value -1.39 and standard deviation 0.39 (Figure \ref{fig:ytd}). We use these values as inputs for all country models.

\subsubsection{Dependence on international tourism}\label{dependence-on-international-tourism}

We model \(b\) as a function of the share of GDP that comes from the sector. Note that the data we have for this are biased towards high-income countries.

We write

\[b\sim\text{Beta}(\alpha(z),\beta(z))\]

where \(z\) is the fraction of GDP coming from the Food and accommodation sector. We learn three parameters \(p^5\), \(p^6\) and \(p^7\) to best fit the relationship between \(z\) and \(b\) in countries we have observations for:

\[p^5 = \alpha(z)+\beta(z)\]

\[p^6 z + p^7 = \frac{\alpha(z)}{\alpha(z)+\beta(z)}\]

Here, \(p^5\) controls the variance of the distribution and \(p^6\) and \(p^7\) the linear relationship between \(z\) and \(b\). Using an optimisation routine in R we find \(p^5=6.73\),
\(p^6=4.14\) and \(p^7=0.05\). Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sectortourism}. We use these values as inputs for all country models.

\subsection{Remote working}\label{remote-working}

For each sector in each country, we have the 90\% interval for the proportion of people who can work from home from \citet{Gottlieb2021}. We assume that the value we sample within the range is related to internet infrastructure, so that a low value in one sector implies low values in all sectors. We:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  take the subset of countries in the income group (LLMIC / UMIC / HIC);
\item
  take the minimum of the lower bounds by sector (5\%);
\item
  take the maximum of the upper bounds by sector (95\%);
\item
  sample from a uniform distribution between these bounds, taking the same quantile for each sector.
\end{itemize}

We assume that remote working happens to its fullest extent for the whole period of mitigation for all policies.

\section{Closure policies}\label{closure-policies}

Impacts of mandated closures of businesses and schools on epidemics can be described using three factors: length, stringency, and frequency. We model mandated closures using a discrete set of predefined policies, which specify the \emph{stringency} of closures in each sector. The policies we use are the same for each country. The length and frequency of economic closures are endogenous to the model (via its epidemiology), and therefore depend on the dynamics of the epidemic that is being modelled.

\subsection{Policy specifications}\label{policy-specifications}

We define four generic policies that might be adopted once a novel pathogen has been identified. The policies represent possible choices that range from very stringent to laissez faire, and are grounded in real-life observations. We name the policies no closures (NC) and reactive closures 1 to 3 (RC1 to RC3), and they are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:policies}, structured by the qualities that distinguish them.

The three sector-closure policies are each defined by a pair of economic configurations, and rules for moving between them. An economic configuration is a vector specifying the extent to which each sector is open, expressed as a percentage. Our economic configurations are constructed using data from three countries (Indonesia (RC1), the United Kingdom (RC2), and Australia (RC3)), via the manifest economic impacts in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We take the sectoral GVA observed the COVID-19 pandemic expressed as a percentage of the values observed in the year before (OECD), i.e.~we assume that the relative GVA reflects the degree to which sectors were open.

In reality, the observed effects combined mandated closures, reductions in consumption and labour supply due to infection avoidance of individuals, interruptions in supply chains, and changes in imports and exports. However, these effects have not been disentangled, and in DAEDALUS we model only the mandate. This is equivalent to saying that we assume the mandate alone determined economic outcomes and we simulate their repeated application. Thus we neglect two factors in our model: first, population behaviour, and second, international trade, and we ignore their impacts in the COVID-19 pandemic by subsuming all effects into the mandate. (e.g.~a pandemic that does not originate in or impact greatly China might have a much smaller economic cost).

\subsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}

The economic configurations define the sector closures for both the economic model and the epidemiological model. Contacts associated with sectors -- between and among workers and customers -- are scaled down with closures. GVA per sector is scaled according to economic configurations in the economic model.

For their dynamic implementation in the model, the three closure policies follow the same general pattern: they are defined by two economic configurations, which we refer to as heavy and light (where the ``heavy'' configuration has higher stringency than the ``light'' configuration; the configurations are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:eccon}). The light configuration is implemented at the response time. Thereafter, the level of closure for the three policies is mandated in response to the state of the epidemic, reverting between states as determined by the transmission dynamics. Tables \ref{tab:rulesreactive} and \ref{tab:ruleselimination} show the transitions and their conditions. RC1 and RC2 respond to hospital occupancy, allowing cases to rise and using closures to allow them to fall again. RC1 keeps schools closed throughout, whereas RC2 has schools open in the light configuration. RC3 aims to reduce cases and then to keep them low. All mitigation is suspended when the vaccine rollout has reached its target coverage (which is when 80\% of the eligible population have been vaccinated).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/policies-1} \caption{The four sector-closure policy options. No closures (NC) does not mandate any closures. The other three policies all implement reactive closures (RC), either in response to hospital occupancy (RC1 and RC2) or $R_t$ (RC3). The difference between RC1 and RC2 is that in RC1 schools are closed throughout, whereas in RC2 schools are fully open during the light configuration.}\label{fig:policies}
\end{figure}

The sector-closure policies are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  NC: No closures are mandated.
\item
  RC1: Schools are mandated to close to 10\% of pre-epidemic levels throughout, and other economic sectors close to the heavy-closure economic configuration when hospital occupancy reaches 95\% of its capacity, and change to the light configuration once occupancy is less than 25\% capacity.
\item
  RC2: Sectors (including the education sector) toggle between heavy and light closures reactively, as in RC1, albeit with slightly different economic configurations.
\item
  RC3: Heavy closures are chosen when \(R_t>1.2\) and light closures when \(R_t<0.95\). Closures are maintained until \(R_t<1\) without closures, or vaccination targets are reached.
\end{itemize}

All policies assume there is testing (Section \ref{testing-and-self-isolating}), working from home (Section \ref{remote-working}), and uncosted transmission reductions from behavioural changes (Section \ref{uncosted-transmission-reductions}), which impact epidemiological outcomes. They do not directly impact economic outcomes, but indirectly may reduce the need for closures because of reduced incidence.

\section{Pathogen profiles}\label{pathogen-profiles}

We sample pathogen profiles by defining distributions over the pathogen parameters. The distributions are made using sourced data (Table \ref{tab:pathogenprofile}), and are described in Table \ref{tab:pathogenparameters}. Age profiles for severity rates are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ratesbyage}. We sample parameter values from distributions informed by the seven pathogen profiles. \(\text{R}_0\) is truncated at 1.5 and 4 following \citet{whittakerQuantifyingImpactBroadly2024}.

\subsubsection{Hospital capacity}\label{hospital-capacity}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/hmax-1} \caption{Hospital capacity: available beds minus usual occupancy.}\label{fig:hmax}
\end{figure}

We model these values with gamma distributions. For LLMICs, we have parameters 1.3 and 0.05. For UMICs, we have parameters 1.73 and 0.02. For HICs, we have parameters 2.05 and 0.02. (Data sources: World Bank (beds); OECD, WHO euro (bed occupancy rates).)

\subsubsection{Labour share of GVA}\label{labour-share-of-gva}

We estimate the average annual income per working-age adult as the total GVA multiplied by the fraction of GVA that goes to labour divided by the number of working-age adults. For the fraction of GVA that goes to labour we use PWT estimates from 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:labsh}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/labsh-1} \caption{Fraction of GVA that goes to labour (PWT, 2011).}\label{fig:labsh}
\end{figure}

We model these values with Beta distributions. For LLMICs, we have parameters 5.09 and 4.51. For UMICs, we have parameters 7.06 and 8.18. For HICs, we have parameters 7.97 and 6.87.

\subsubsection{Vaccine administration}\label{vaccine-administration}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-latex/vaxrate-1} \caption{Vaccines administered per day, on average, in each country as a percent of population. Data source: fully vaccinated people from OWID (2022).}\label{fig:vaxrate}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:vaxrate} shows histograms of COVID-19 vaccine administration rates by income level. Values are estimates of administration rates of complete schedules given. Administration rates are estimated as the best-fit slope observed in the pandemic period (Figure \ref{fig:vaxratemx}). The administration slope ideally represents the highest rate possible: rates are often low to begin with, due to limited supply. They are often low at the end, due to depleted demand.

Using the method illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:vaxratemx}, we estimate how many countries per income group surpassed an average maximum rate of 0.5\% of the population per day: 7\% of HICs, 2\% of UMICs, and 5\% of LLMICs.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{README_files/figure-gfm/vax_rate_MX} \caption{Vaccine administration in Mexico. The blue line shows the average rate over the whole vaccination campaign. The yellow line shows the average rate when administration was rate limiting.}\label{fig:vaxratemx}
\end{figure}

In LMICs and LICs, there was arguably not a period of vaccine delivery in which the rate was limited by neither demand nor supply. Therefore we use an alternative source to validate our choices of administration rate in different scenarios.

Figure \ref{fig:vaxratewho} shows that in 40\% of vaccination campaigns in LLMICs, the rate exceeded 0.2\% of the population per day; in 28\% of campaigns, the rate exceeded 0.4\% of the population per day; and in 13\% of campaigns, the rate exceeded 1\% of the population per day. We use these rates of delivery for LLMIC synthetic countries.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{README_files/figure-gfm/vaccinationrates} \caption{Vaccine administration rates in LLMICs. Shown is the cumulative distribution of delivery rate, measured as the \% of the population vaccinated per day. The data consist of 141 points, from 55 countries that are currently classified as LIC or LMIC, from the years 2000 to 2022, of programmes for measles, MR or MMR vaccines, lasting two weeks or more [@whoSummaryMeaslesRubellaSupplementary2022]. The types of programme include campaigns and outbreak response as well as catch up, follow up, speed up, and mop up.}\label{fig:vaxratewho}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Compliance with the requirement to self isolate}\label{compliance-with-the-requirement-to-self-isolate}

We use a broad Beta distribution with parameters (5,5) to describe the compliance of the population with the requirement to isolate if symptomatic or positive. A YouGov survey \citep{jonessarahpImperialCollegeLondon2020} asked ``If you were advised to do so by a healthcare professional or public health authority to what extent are you willing or not to self-isolate for 7 days?'' The question was asked in 30 different countries (21 high income, five upper-middle income, four lower-middle income) and 63 different weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of 837,368 people.

The possible answers were `Very unwilling', `Somewhat unwilling', `Neither willing nor unwilling', `Not sure', `Somewhat willing', `Very willing'. Excluding the answer `Not sure', and weighting all other answers on a uniform scale of 0 to 1, the average compliance from all participants is 84\%. The range across countries is 73\% to 90\%. The average value for the UK is 87\%. In contrast, \citet{Smith2021} found that duration-adjusted adherence to full self isolation was 42.5\%. The average value for Australia was 88\%. A survey undertaken in 2009 found that 55\% of households complied with quarantine requirements (\url{https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-2}).

\section{Notation}\label{notation}

In general in this notation, subscripts are indices, and superscripts are never indices but instead define new labels. In particular, note that numerical superscripts are attached to letters \(k\) for rates and \(p\) for parameters. Where a power is applied to one of these letters, the letter will be enclosed in parentheses for clarity.
